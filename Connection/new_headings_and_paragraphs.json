    "context": "Top 10 Most Scraped Websites in 2025\n\nAnsel Barrett March 6, 2025 8 min read\n\nBest Web Scraping Tool for Anyone\n\nBefore starting, we’d like to introduce an easy-to-use web scraping tool. Octoparse, which is designed for both non-coders and coders. With its auto-detecting function and preset scraping templates, you can scrape any popular website without coding. What’s more, you can customize the crawler with its advanced functions such as cloud scraping, proxies, IP rotation, etc.\n\nWhat is an Octoparse task template? For programmers, to scrape the web, they can write scripts and run them in Python or whatever way. A task template is like an already written script and the only part you have to do is to figure out what data you want and enter the keywords or URLs on our task template interface. You can find the data scraping template both online and on the desktop software, try the general one below to make your web scraping easy.\n\nContact Details Scraper Social Media Not just an email extractor, but a universal scraper that extracts contact details from any website and its subpages.\n\nWhat Types of Websites are Popular for Scraping\n\nWhen it comes to web scraping, certain types of websites are more frequently targeted due to the valuable data they offer. These websites typically provide large volumes of publicly available information, making them ideal for businesses, researchers, and marketers. In this section, we’ll explore the types of websites that are most commonly scraped and why they attract so much attention.\n\nE-commerce sites\n\nE-commerce sites are always the most scraped websites among others, both in frequency and quantity. As shopping online becomes a household lifestyle, e-commerce affects people from all walks of life. Online sellers, storefront retailers, and even consumers are all e-commerce data collectors.\n\nMost E-commerce websites use a hierarchical structure, such as Amazon, one of the most visited websites on the world (according to SEMRush report, Amazon has more than 2.6 billion visits per month). Users browse products in lists sorted by categories and filters. They then open pages with detailed information about each product.\n\nOne of the most used methods for scraping Amazon and other E-commerce websites is list crawling.\n\nDirectories sites for leads\n\nDirectories sites earn the second rank in the race, and this isn’t surprising at all. Directories sites organize businesses by categories and thus serve as a functional information filter which is a good pick for efficient data collection.\n\nIn terms of site structure, directories show organized business lists. The homepage and category pages help users filter results. Each listing includes contact details and business info.\n\nMany are scraping directory sites for extracting emails, phone numbers and other contact information to boost their sales leads.\n\nSocial media sites\n\nSocial media incorporates a wealth of information concerning human opinions, emotions, and daily actions. Other than that, they are often popular sites; for example, Facebook is the top 3 most visited website, gaining more than 9.6 billion visits per month.\n\nMost social media sites feature dynamic feeds and user profiles. Content is shown in timelines or grids. Navigation sorts posts by topics, hashtags, or user connections.\n\nGenerally speaking, scraping data from social media sites is more challenging than from others. That is because many social media sites employ strong anti-scraping techniques to protect users’ privacy. Yet, social media still serves as an important source of information for sentiment analysis and all kinds of research.\n\nOthers\n\nOther sites fall into categories such as Jobs, Tourism, Real Estate, and Search Engine. People of all industries are taking advantage of the web scraping technique to exploit data value to serve their interests.\n\nBefore learning the top 10 most popular websites in detail, you should know the legality problems of web scraping.

    "context": "What Is Web Scraping – Basics & Practical Uses\n\nAbigail Jones January 24, 2023 11 min read\n\nWhat is Web Scraping\n\nIn short, web scraping is a way to download data from web pages.\n\nYou may have heard some of its nicknames like data scraping, data extraction, or web crawling. Among these, web crawling could be narrower and refer to data scraping done by search engine bots. But in most cases, they all refer to the same meaning – a programmatic way to pull data from the web.\n\nIn essence, web scraping is a dedicated data collector who captures the exact set of data you want from a load of web pages and makes it into a neat file for your download and further use. It helps fetch data like product information, phone numbers, email addresses, articles, etc., from websites and organize it into certain forms like Excel, CSV, HTML, etc., or databases like Google Sheets.\n\nSee how Wikipedia explains web scraping:\n\n“The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).”\n\nRead the article in infographics\n\nWhat is the Point of Web Scraping\n\nBig Data and Automation are no longer new concepts in the current business world. People use them to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nBig data is big for the amount. Automation is about getting things done on autopilot. Web scraping is good at both – getting voluminous data fast with little human labor required.\n\nIn the context of big data collection, web scraping is the rescue. If you want to train a machine learning model, a great amount of accurate input data will make you smile. This data will teach your model important lessons and get you a more intelligent algorithm. That’s when web scraping plays the ace – to grab your data efficiently from a number of websites and get it into a machine-readable format for quick use.\n\nWell, not everyone has an AI model to train, but most of us need to collect data for different purposes. Web scraping’s nature of automation improves people’s working efficiency and eliminates human errors. Lay back and let the robot do what is repetitive.\n\nHow Does Web Scraping Work\n\nWebsites’ data is written in HTML files. Browsers like Chrome and Firefox are tools that read the HTML file to us. Therefore, no matter how diverse web pages are presented to us, every string of data we see in the browser is already written in the HTML source code. With XPath, a language that locates elements on the page, you can trace what you see in the code.\n\nWeb scraping finds the right data according to where it locates and takes a series of actions, such as extracting the selected text, extracting the hyperlink, inputting preset data, clicking certain buttons, etc., just like a human, except that it surfs the Internet and copies the data fast around the clock and feels no fatigue.\n\nOnce the data is ready, you will be able to download it from the cloud or to the local file for any further use.\n\nHow is Web Scraping Used\n\nWho uses web scraping and how does it empower them? Read the use cases below, and then you may discover how web scraping could benefit you as well.\n\nWho is using web scraping\n\nThey get data mostly for price monitoring, price comparison, competitor analysis, big data analysis, etc., that serve their decision-making process and business strategies.\n\nFor individuals, web scraping helps professionals like:\n\nThey can apply web scraping to obtain data that supports their sales, marketing, research, and analysis.\n\nDoes web scraping sound like a big undertaking to you? Believe me, it is not. It can be used in many trivial ways and help you out of tedious, repetitive work. Basically, if you need data that could be found on websites and you don’t want to do mind-numbing copies and pastes manually, you use web scraping.\n\nRead also:\n\nWhat are the most scraped data and websites\n\nAccording to the post Most Scraped Websites, e-commerce marketplaces, directory websites, and social media platforms are the more scraped websites in general. Websites like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Yellow Pages, Craigslist, and social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn are among the popular.\n\nWhat data are people getting from these sites? Well, everything that serves their research or sales.\n\nThe need to migrate data is also one of the reasons people choose web scraping. A scraper then works out like a grand CTRL+C action and helps copy data from one place to another for the user.\n\nYou may be interested in web scraping business ideas to discover more detailed information about how web scraping is used in practical scenarios.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Web Scraping\n\nBecause of its accuracy and efficiency, web scraping empowers individuals and businesses in many ways. However, worries always exist – will it be too complicated to handle? Is it hard to fix and maintain? Well, fair questions. If you get the opportunity to dive into it, you will see the advantages of web scraping very likely outweigh what means to you the tricky part.\n\nThe advantages of web scraping\n\nHigh speed\n\nIt is self-evident that web scraping can help people get data faster. It may be the core reason people resort to web scraping. Compared to manually doing this, a web scraper can execute your commands automatically, according to the workflow you have built for it. Each step of work that would have taken up your time will be done by the scraper.\n\nOnce you set it up, it will run for you relentlessly, getting all kinds of web data fast from different websites. If you wanna try how fast a scraper can be, I recommend you try our scraper templates. You may try an Amazon scraper to gather product details or product reviews and see how a scraper can get you hundreds of well-structured data lines in just a minute.\n\nThus, web scraping is a valuable tool to study market trends and gaps, the voice of your customers, and the gestures of your competitors since it helps grab this data fast and easily from all different sources.\n\nDownload Octoparse to witness the speed of web scraping now.\n\n“Time is money!” ——Benjamin Franklin\n\nCost-effectiveness\n\nWeb scraping is widely accepted by not only big companies but also SMBs. It just saves money.\n\nFirst of all, hiring a development team would cost a lot. Looking for the right talents, dealing with leadership and management stuff to put them together and work effectively, and human resources issues, all of these are time-consuming (and sometimes psyche-consuming).\n\nWeb scraping takes repetitive work without the need for a coffee break. Unless you have a long-term development plan to carry out (or you have a big budget to squander), web scraping is worth a try.\n\nThe returns of setting up a scraper (or a set of scrapers) can be considerable.\n\nFor example, if you want a series of product price information and get it updated daily for a year, you may spend a few days or even weeks configuring the scrapers, testing, and fine-tuning it. Once it is well-built, it can work for you as long as you need it. Fresh price data will be delivered to you every morning, more punctual than the employees in your office.\n\nWell, it is not a once-for-all work. You may spend some time maintaining the scraper# now and then, but it saves you a grand number compared to the cost of data delivery for 365 sets of price data a year.\n\nRelated Reading: How Does Web Scraping Cost\n\nCompatibility and flexibility\n\nhe flexibility of web scraping enables you to get data exactly in the form you need it. For example, a regular expression is one of the ways to get your data cleaned. You can set commands with regex to refine the strings of data by adding a prefix, replacing A with B, cutting certain bytes of data, etc.\n\nYou can use Regex to remove the string “(415)” from every number in your spreadsheet if you are scraping San Francisco local business numbers for your telemarketing system. Data can be cleaned as the scraper processes.\n\nFile formats also make things easier. Octoparse scrapes web data into EXCEL, CSV, HTML, and JSON formats. These files are compatible with most apps and systems of data management, data analysis, and visualization.\n\nAn Octoparse user once told us that he is running a price comparison website. He set the tasks to run daily so that the prices were fresh. The data scraped is automatically exported to his database which connects to his website.\n\nA web scraper can be a data pipeline that extracts data from the web, cleans it, organizes it into the right format, and copies it to your database which could be then uploaded to your websites and systems. You can’t imagine how an individual could run and maintain a website by himself, getting the data on it refreshed every day without web scraping.\n\nCapacity to get data that API can’t\n\nAPI is short for Application Programming Interface. An API gives people access to the data of an application or system that is granted by the owner.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n“An API is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change.”\n\nHence what data you can get through API highly depends on which part of the information is open to the public. In most cases, applications and services would offer only limited access to the public free of charge or sometimes at a cost.\n\nThe specification to build an API connection varies from app to app. If you are looking for data from only one or a few sources, and luckily the data you need is all granted, you can study the API specification and take advantage of it. Honestly, maintaining an API connection could be easier than maintaining a web scraper.\n\nA web scraping tool can become a data console where you gather data from different websites with a series of scrapers and become a data pipeline when you connect the tool to your database. A web scraper can ignore the limit of API and extract what data you can see on the browser. Therefore, web scraping is more customizable, and when you need data from multiple sources, more powerful as an aggregator.\n\nThe disadvantages of web scraping\n\nWeb scraping is powerful, and you may have heard of some of its’ limits and wonder if you are able to deal with them. For example, during the scraping, we can get blocked by the target websites. In this section, we will have a closer look at them.\n\nTips:If you want to know more possible obstacles, check article 9 web scraping challenges are discussed. Octoparse has its customizable solutions to different situations. If you are stuck in any one of these issues and wonder if Octoparse can be your alternative solution, feel free to contact us at support@octoparse.com. Our colleagues are happy to help.\n\nStart with a learning curve\n\nWeb scraping tasks can be a lot easier with a no-code web scraping tool like Octoparse since a non-coder does not have to learn Python, R, or PHP from scratch and can take advantage of the intuitive UI and the guide panel.\n\nHowever, even a web scraping tool takes time to get familiar with because you have to understand the basic idea of how a web scraper works so that you can command the tool to help you build the scraper.\n\nFor example, you shall know how the data is weaved into an HTML file with different HTML tags and structures. You may learn the basics of Xpath to locate the data you need. This is also what I learned (and more) throughout my journey with Octoparse.\n\nYour IP may be blocked\n\nWeb scraping is about frequently visiting a website or a set of web pages, sometimes clicking and sending many requests in a short period of time (so as to capture the required data on the pages). Because of the abnormal frequency, your device or IP may be detected as a suspicious robot that is executing malicious attacks on the service.\n\nIP blocking is likely to happen when you scrape websites that are protected with strict anti-scraping techniques, such as LinkedIn and Facebook. The tracking and detection are mainly based on the IP footprint. Therefore, IP rotation or using IP proxies is an important technique for anti-blocking.\n\nThis is inevitable due to the speed of web scraping, while solutions like IP proxies and Cloud services offer a way out. Learn more about web scraping limitations.\n\nWeb scraper requires maintenance\n\nThe scraper is built to grab data according to the HTML structure. If the website you are scraping has changed its structure, for example, the data you need is moving from place A to place B, you then have to amend your scraper to adjust to the change.\n\nWe have no control over the external website, hence only keeping up with it. As long as you get a hang of a web scraping tool, and become familiar with the anti-scraping tricks, it would be easier for you to react to these changes.\n\nHow to Start Web Scraping\n\nThere are a lot of crash courses on platforms like YouTube and Medium to teach people how to start learning web scraping with Python. Honestly, not everyone is good at coding. If you are a total newbie in programming, you can start with a no-code or low-code method. It can be a perfect choice because you can still get the data you want without writing any line of code.\n\nA use case is that a user needs to scrape YouTube data for marketing purposes. But she could not write a line of code. So she worked in Octoparse, a no-code web scraping tool.\n\nOctoparse: A No-code Solution for Web Scraping\n\nIf you are looking for a way to get data with web scraping and want to start easy, a no-code tool would be a nice pick even though you are new to it. Compared with writing scripts to build scrapers, using a no-code tool like Octoparse is definitely more time-saving and effortless.\n\nWhen the user we mentioned above started using Octoparse, it only took her about two weeks to get familiar with the software and learn about the basics of HTML and XPath (these can help locate elements on the page more accurately). Then she successfully built a YouTube scraper herself and got the wanted data. If you are interested in this story, you can check the article on how a marketer made use of no-code web scraping at work on Medium.\n\nAnd here are some resources you may need along the way as you get onboard:\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

    "context": "Learn Everything About List Crawling In 5 Minutes\n\nAnsel Barrett September 16, 2025 5 min read\n\nList Crawling VS General Web Crawling\n\nList crawling is focused and structured. Instead of visiting every page, you target a specific set of pages that share the same layout — for example, a product category, job board, or review list — and extract the same fields from each item (title, price, description, etc.).\n\nGeneral web crawling, on the other hand, is about visiting as many pages as possible and indexing their content — like how Google crawls the internet to build search results. It’s broad, shallow, and designed to discover pages.\n\nThink of it this way: General crawling = “Find me everything.” List crawling = “Collect this exact type of data from every item in this list.”\n\nList crawling also usually involves handling pagination, infinite scroll, and repeated patterns, whereas general crawling just follows links without worrying about data structure.\n\nWhat Types of Websites Are Best Suited for List Crawling?\n\nAfter crawling thousands of sites, I’ve found certain characteristics predict success consistently.\n\nTL;DR: Where Listings Show Up Most\n\n1. E-commerce and Product Catalogs\n\nWhen I visit sites like manufacturer product pages or marketplace listings, I look for\n\nAmazon product pages represent the gold standard for list crawling.\n\nEvery product listing follows the same template, pagination works predictably, and the data structure remains consistent even when visual designs change.\n\n2. Business Directories and Service Listings\n\nSites like Yelp or industry directories present company information in standardized formats. Contact details, hours of operation, and review data follow consistent structures whether you’re browsing by location or category.\n\nWhen I analyze directory sites, I check that business listings include the same information fields and that the organization remains logical. Other than that, geographic filtering and category browsing should work predictably across the entire site.\n\n3. Job Boards and Career Sites\n\nJob posting sites use standardized formats that make extraction reliable. Salary information, location data, company details, and posting dates appear consistently across listings.\n\nI’ve had excellent crawling results with sites like Indeed or company career pages because they depend on users being able to compare similar positions quickly. This business requirement forces consistent data presentation, which makes it perfect for crawling.\n\n4. Review and Content Platforms\n\nReview sites present user feedback in uniform structures with consistent rating systems and temporal organization.\n\nNews aggregators and content platforms use standardized article previews with publication metadata.\n\nThe common thread across successful targets: they present similar information with identical layouts. When you see the same data fields repeated with minimal variation, you’ve found an ideal list crawling site.\n\nHow To Tell if a Website’s Lists Are Crawlable?\n\nBefore I decide whether or not I can listcrawl a website, I run through a five-minute assessment. This assessment helps me decide whether the site will cooperate or fight against my extraction attempts.\n\n1. Inspect Page Source Content\n\nTo get to the page source content you can just right-click any list item and view page source. Then, look for HTML elements containing your target data, consistent class names across similar items, and structured markup like JSON-LD.\n\nIf you can see your target data clearly in the HTML source, it’s crawlable.\n\nNote: empty divs or placeholder text that gets filled by JavaScript indicates dynamic content requiring more sophisticated techniques..\n\n2. Check URL Structure Patterns\n\nCrawlable lists use predictable URL patterns for navigation. I recommend looking for predictable URL patterns in pagination, such as:\n\nRed flags include URLs that don’t change or have complex JavaScript-generated tokens. One time, I spent days on a site where pages all shared the same URL but different content loaded via JavaScript—pagination was fully dynamic.\n\n3. Test Navigation Behavior\n\nWhat I’d do is click through three or four pages manually.\n\nPage numbers should work consistently, the browser back button should function properly, and list items should load immediately without delays.\n\nWhen you find broken pagination, inconsistent navigation, or complex loading sequences, your web crawler configure may need some adjustment such as writing a Xpath for the pagination.\n\n4. Check Rate Limiting Response\n\nOpen five or six pages rapidly in new browser tabs.\n\nPages that fail to load, display CAPTCHA challenges, or show “too many requests” messages indicate your automated crawling could be too aggressive.\n\nList Crawling Different Type of Websites\n\nWhen I don’t want to deal with coding and debugging, I’d prefer Octoparse for list crawling because it handles the technical complexity while letting me focus on getting the data I need.\n\nYou can download it free and it works on Windows (Mac version available too).\n\nDifferent websites structure list data differently, so I always tailor my approach based on the type of list I’m dealing with. Here’s how I handle the three most common list structures:\n\n1. How to Crawl Table-Based Lists\n\nAfter I have assessed that the target data is table list, first thing I do is to open Octoparse. I click “Start with a URL” and paste the first page of the list I want to crawl.\n\nThe software loads the page in its built-in browser so I can see exactly what I’m working with.\n\nIn this case, I am crawling CNN Markets, which is typical table list page.\n\nThen, I use the Auto-detect web page data feature, which quickly scans the page and highlights the table elements, selecting rows and columns automatically.\n\nIf the auto-detect misses something, I manually select the first cell of the first row and expand the selection until the entire row is highlighted. Octoparse then finds the other rows with similar structures for me.\n\nAfter that, I check that all the columns I want are included, rename any column headers for clarity, and remove unused fields. If the table spans multiple pages, I set up pagination by telling Octoparse how to click “Next” to crawl additional pages.\n\nFinally, I run a test extraction to ensure all rows and cells are captured accurately before running the full list crawling and exporting the data in CSV or Excel format.\n\nFuther Reading You can learn more about crawling or scraping table data in Octoparse from our tutorial.\n\n2. Crawling Data Inside Tabs or Tabbed Interfaces\n\nSometimes, websites use tabs to organize list data within one page—like product variants, specs, or user reviews in separate tabbed panels.\n\nI load the webpage with tabs and set up actions to click each tab sequentially, ensuring the content within becomes visible for extraction. I then use the auto-detect feature or manual selection to capture data inside each tab.\n\nIf there are multiple tabs or nested lists, I configure looping so Octoparse dynamically visits and extracts information from every tabbed section.\n\nA key trick is adding appropriate waiting times in the workflow when switching tabs, to let the page content load fully, especially if the tabs load data via JavaScript or AJAX.\n\n3. Crawling Listing & Detail Page Structures\n\nFor websites that display product or article listings linking to detail pages, the crawling process involves two main steps: scraping the overview on the listing page, then clicking into each detail page to extract additional information.\n\nI begin by entering the listing page URL into Octoparse and running the auto-detect feature to identify all items on the page. This creates a loop item extracting common data like product title, price, or summary.\n\nNext, I configure Octoparse to click on each listing automatically and navigate to the detail page, where I set up additional data fields to extract finer details—such as full descriptions, specifications, or reviews.\n\nPagination is also set up so Octoparse loads and extracts data from multiple listing pages. After confirming everything works smoothly in a test run, I execute the full crawl. This approach allows me to build rich datasets combining summary and detailed information efficiently.\n\nFuther Reading You can learn in greater details about crawling detailed page data with this brief tutorial.\n\nWhy I Love This Layered Approach\n\nBreaking the process down by list type keeps things straightforward for beginners while allowing technical readers to dive deeper if they want. Plus, Octoparse’s visual, point-and-click interface means even complex list crawls are accessible.\n\nIf you want to learn more about any of these techniques, I’ve linked to detailed tutorials that walk you through them step-by-step.\n\nCommon List Crawling Issues and How to Fix Them\n\n1. No Data or Partial Data Extracted\n\nThis usually means the page didn’t load fully or the selection missed elements. To fix this:\n\n2. Pagination Skips Pages or Misses Data\n\nMisconfigured pagination often leads to data loss. I:\n\n3. Duplicate Rows in Exported Data\n\nDuplicate data often results from pagination errors like Octoparse clicking the same page twice or looping incorrectly. My fixes include:\n\n4. Task Stucks or Freezes Mid-Run\n\nDynamic websites or heavy JavaScript can cause hang-ups. You should:\n\n5. Encountering CAPTCHAs or Blocks\n\nCAPTCHAs can completely stop crawling. I handle these by:\n\nHow I Clean and Prepare My Scraped Data\n\nAfter scraping a list of data, it’s normal to find some problems that can make your analysis harder later on. For example, you might see:\n\nHere’s what I do to get my data in good shape:\n\nTools I Use For Data Cleaning\n\nHere’s a simple Python example of removing duplicates and filling missing prices:\n\nimport pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('scraped_data.csv') df = df.drop_duplicates() df['price'] = df['price'].fillna(df['price'].mean()) df.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)\n\nGood data cleaning saves me time down the road, improves the accuracy of my analysis, and helps me trust the insights from my scraped lists.\n\nCommon Questions About List Crawling\n\n1. How can I handle dynamically loaded list content like infinite scroll or content inside tabs?\n\nMany modern sites use JavaScript to load list items dynamically as you scroll or when clicking tabs. To handle this, use tools that can execute JavaScript, like Octoparse’s built-in browser or Selenium. You may need to simulate scrolling actions or tab clicks and add wait times to give content time to load before extraction.\n\n2. How do I avoid my crawler getting blocked when scraping dynamic lists?\n\nUse proxy rotation, slow down request speeds with random delays, rotate user agents, and respect site rate limits. Octoparse offers IP proxy support and CAPTCHA solving to minimize blocks.\n\n3. Can I scrape data from login-protected or session-based lists?\n\nWhen a website requires login to see the data you want, your crawler needs to handle the login process automatically. Here’s how I do it in simple steps with Octoparse:\n\nIf you want a detailed walk through about How to Scrape Data Behind a login.\n\n4. Can I get into trouble for crawling publicly available lists?\n\nGenerally, crawling publicly available list pages (like product catalogs or directories) is allowed.\n\nHowever, some sites explicitly prohibit automated data collection in their terms of service, which can lead to IP blocking or legal challenges. I would recommedn you to always review the site’s policies and consider asking for permission when in doubt.\n\nFuther Reading We discussed more in detailed in our blog about Is Web Scraping Legal. Feel free to check it out.\n\nConclusion\n\nList crawling is the backbone of most web data extraction today, and knowing how to grab structured data from pages loaded with lists makes all the difference.\n\nThe trick is knowing when a site is crawl-friendly, how to dodge common traps like broken pagination or CAPTCHAs, and using tools like Octoparse to make it simple—even if you’re not a coder.\n\nAnd don’t forget the legal side: stay within site policies, respect user privacy laws, and only collect data you’re allowed to use.\n\nWhen you master these principles, list crawling becomes a practical and powerful tool for gathering the high-quality data you need.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

    "context": "How to Extract Emails in 2025 (Without Wasting Time on Dead Methods)\n\nAnsel Barrett September 10, 2025 5 min read\n\nFree Manual Methods to Find Emails in 2025\n\nNot every project needs paid tools or automation. If you’re just starting out, here are some reliable free methods that still work today:\n\n1. Google Search Operators\n\nUse “Google dorking” to uncover emails hidden in search results.\n\nQueries like site:company.com “@company.com” or “CEO” + “@company.com” often reveal direct contacts.\n\n2. Email Pattern Guessing\n\nMost companies follow predictable formats (e.g., firstname.lastname@domain.com). By checking a few public emails, you can guess the rest. A quick spreadsheet of variations helps confirm likely addresses.\n\n3. Social Profiles & Newsletters\n\nLinkedIn bios, Twitter handles, and company newsletters often share contact emails that aren’t on the main site. Subscribing to newsletters can even give you a direct sender email to reply to.\n\n4. Page Source & Copy-Paste Extractors\n\nRight-click → View Page Source → search for “@”. You’ll often find backup emails hidden in HTML or form code. To save time, paste the text into a free extractor tool (like Email-Checker or ConvertCSV) to pull out all addresses at once.\n\nThese manual approaches take more effort than premium tools, but for targeted outreach or one-off projects, they’re still surprisingly effective.\n\nEmail Extractor VS Buying Email Lists\n\nBuying email lists seems easier, but I’ve learned it’s usually a mistake.\n\nWhen you extract directly from websites, you get current information, but bought lists often contain outdated emails that bounce. On the other hand, an email extractor can offers you a better targeting, since you can choose exactly which websites and industries to target, while bought lists are usually generic and poorly matched to your needs.\n\nWhat is an Email Extractor? An email extractor or email address extractor is a tool that automatically gathers email addresses, often in bulk; it can save you hours of manual work.\n\nHow to Extract Emails Using Automated Tools\n\nMethod #1. Use a Web Scraping Tool Like Octoparse\n\nOctoparse is a powerful yet simple-to-use web scraping tool that requires no coding. It can extract bulk email addresses and other contact details from many websites, including directories like Yellow Pages.\n\nThere are different types of preset templates to scrape contact info quickly from popular directory websites.\n\nFor example, Octoparse Email Extractor can scrape emails, phone numbers, and addresses and exports them to Excel or CSV files.\n\nhttps://www.octoparse.com/template/contact-details-scraper\n\nYou just need to input some search keywords or locations (fill in the required parameters), click a run button, and then wait for the data to be collected. The scraped data can easily be downloaded to an Excel or CSV file, or even directly to your databases. It is not a problem to scrape data by using Octoparse pre-defined templates.\n\nHere is how I use it to pull the email address from websites:\n\nStep 1. Sign up for a free account\n\nStep 2. Enter the URL of the website or page you want to scrape.\n\nPaste in the URL(s) where you want to collect emails. You can add one domain or import a list of sites from a file.\n\nStep 3. Adjust crawl settings (optional)\n\nStep 4. Run the scraper locally or in the cloud. What I love about this tool is that I can even schedule scraping tasks with this extractor.\n\nStep 5. Choose Cloud Scraping Mode\n\nStep 6. Export your results Once the scraper finishes, download the results in Excel/CSV. You’ll see extracted emails, phone numbers, and sometimes social media links — all in one sheet.\n\nThis saved me hours of manual searching. I dropped in a list of startup websites, let Octoparse run in the background, and came back to a clean CSV of verified contact details. For anyone starting outreach, it’s a big productivity boost.\n\nYou can also explore more easy-to-use email scraping tools like Octoparse for lead generation.\n\nMethod #2. Build Your Own Email Scraper Using Python\n\nStep 1: Install Python (if you don’t have it)\n\nStep 2: Install required packages\n\nOpen terminal and run:\n\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n\nIf you get permission errors, try:\n\npip install --user requests beautifulsoup4\n\nStep 3: Extract emails from text\n\nCreate a file called extract_emails.py:\n\npython import re def find_emails_in_text(text): email_pattern = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b' emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text) return list(set(emails)) # Remove duplicates # Paste your text here sample_text = \"\"\" Contact us at support@example.com or sales@company.org For partnerships: partner@business.net \"\"\" found_emails = find_emails_in_text(sample_text) for email in found_emails: print(email)\n\nStep 4: Extract from websites (add this to your file):\n\npython import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def extract_from_website(url): try: response = requests.get(url, timeout=10) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser') page_text = soup.get_text() return find_emails_in_text(page_text) except Exception as e: print(f\"Error accessing {url}: {e}\") return [] # Usage website_emails = extract_from_website('https://example.com') print(website_emails)\n\nIn case you run into these issues:\n\nAlso, Requests, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup are a few of the many free Python programs available for web scraping, crawling, and parsing.\n\nIf you wish, look into a few of them and see which one best suits your needs. You can also easily find many ready-to-use scripts that scrape email addresses in python from Github.\n\nMethod #3. Use Email Extractor (Chrome Extension)\n\nThis extension can extract emails quickly and lets you export your contact list to CSV or copy selected emails. It can even gather emails linked to domains.\n\nWhat I love about this extension is that it can find all email accounts associated with a given domain name.\n\nFor instance, let’s say I want to find out who works at Email Hunter, I can use the tool to look for any email address that ends in hunter.io or emailhunter.io. This can be done for any website.\n\nWell, these are three methods I tested to efficiently get the email address I want for regular websites. But, there could be other websites that might need a different approach.\n\nWhat About Youtube & Linkedin?\n\nHow to Extract Emails from YouTube\n\nYouTube channels often include business contact emails in their “About” section.\n\nManual process: Navigate to channel → About tab → “View email address” → Complete CAPTCHA.\n\nFor bulk extraction, tools like IGLeads and Prosperity automate this by processing channel URLs and scraping publicly available contact information from channel descriptions.\n\nIf you already have an Octoparse account, or you want to try its free trail, you can actually build your own Youtube scraper without coding to pull the information you want.\n\nLinkedIn Email Extraction\n\nLinkedIn restricts automated scraping through rate limiting and bot detection.\n\nCompliant extraction requires tools like Kaspr or GetProspect that respect LinkedIn’s API limits and focus on publicly visible profile information.\n\nPlease note that you should never attempt to scrape private LinkedIn data or exceed platform-imposed viewing limits.\n\nHow to Legally Scrape Emails\n\nWhen I started extracting emails for European clients, I quickly realized I was walking into a legal minefield. After spending two weeks researching GDPR requirements and consulting with our legal team, I developed this compliance checklist that’s kept me out of trouble across dozens of extraction projects.\n\nMy GDPR Research Process:\n\nHere’s a checklist to help you stay on the right side of the law while still getting results:\n\nThis checklist has worked across 15+ countries and multiple client industries.\n\nWhen in doubt, stick to publicly available business contact information and always err on the side of caution. Feel free to check out our guide “Is Web Scraping Legal” for more detail.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing an email extractor is a fast and reliable way to build a qualified contact list for your sales and marketing efforts. Instead of hunting through pages yourself, you get a ready-to-use contact list in minutes.\n\nThis means you can focus more on crafting your sales or marketing strategy, rather than spending hours collecting leads one by one. Plus, targeted contact lists help improve your campaign’s performance and increase engagement rates.\n\nI highly recommend you use a powerful web scraping tool like Octoparse.\n\nOf course, you can also write your own Python script, or install a handy Chrome extension. They are all valid ways that quickly extract email addresses in bulk from websites or local files.\n\nBut it’s not just about gathering tons of emails. The real value comes from how you use them.\n\nPair your bulk email lists with smart email marketing tools and personalized message content to turn those leads into loyal customers.\n\nAs search engines evolve, clean and relevant contact data will remain invaluable for outreach and growth. Keep your email lists updated, use ethical scraping methods, and always respect privacy regulations to ensure long-term success.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

    "context": "How To Extract Phone Numbers From A Website?\n\nAbigail Jones October 1, 2024 6 min read\n\nHow to Make Effective Business Phone Calls\n\nPhone numbers are relatively sensitive and not-easy-to-get data. So you should definitely use them wisely. How can you make an effective business call?\n\nFirst, always get yourself prepared before the phone call. It would be best if you could gather enough information about the person you’re going to connect with. For example, if you can address his/her title, name, and possible business concerns (how your product or service can help them solve the problem) correctly and concisely. This way, calls are less likely to be rejected.\n\nTo achieve your goal in one call, you also have to think about the messages you are going to deliver, the goal you’d like to achieve, the way you’d like to be “asked” when exchanging ideas, when is an appropriate time to call, how long should the call be, etc. Check this guide to learn more marketing-calling tips.\n\nHow to Find Accurate Phone Numbers\n\nBefore you can start collecting any phone numbers for your marketing campaigns, you should know where to find this information, i.e. data sources for the particular customer groups you are interested in.\n\nToday, personal data can be quite sensitive. It is suggested to gather public web data to minimize any possible illegal consequences. As for phone numbers, business phone numbers are usually deemed less private and safer to collect.\n\nHere are some popular online business data sources for various business categories.

    "context": "Is Web Crawling Legal and Why\n\nAbigail Jones August 26, 2023 9 min read\n\nIs Web Crawling Legal\n\nLet’s start with the question in the title. Is web crawling legal? Well, it depends. There is a lot of uncertainty regarding the legality of web crawling, including how you do that, how you use the scraped data, and the legal theories and laws.\n\nHow You Do Web Crawling\n\nGenerally, scraping public information from websites is legal, whereas scraping private account data will raise privacy concerns. Here are a few popular use cases to show how different industries do web scraping in a well-accepted way.\n\nE-commerce: Retails use web scraping to automate marketplace price monitoring, build up product profiles, and collect customer reviews for sentiment analysis among diverse online shopping platforms like Amazon and eBay. Marketing and Advertising: Content creators apply web crawling to collect data from various social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube to generate new ideas for content marketing and understand what audiences are interested in. Real Estate: Realtors scrape listings from property websites like Realtor.com to aggregate loads of research data for comparison. In that way, they predict if the real estate market will skyrocket any time soon or see in what price range their property will compete.\n\nHow You Use Scraped Data\n\nIf you’re doing web crawling for your own purposes, then it is legal as it falls under the fair use doctrine such as market research and academic research. The complications start if you want to use scraped data for others, especially commercial purposes.\n\nQuoted from Wikipedia.org, eBay v. Bidder’s Edge, 100 F.Supp.2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2000), was a leading case applying the trespass to chattels doctrine to online activities. In 2000, eBay, an online auction company, successfully used the ‘trespass to chattels’ theory to obtain a preliminary injunction preventing Bidder’s Edge, an auction data aggregator, from using a ‘crawler’ to gather data from eBay’s website. The opinion was a leading case applying ‘trespass to chattels’ to online activities, although its analysis has been criticized in more recent jurisprudence.\n\nThe Legal Theories and Laws in Different Countries\n\nThe versatility of web scraping allows access to data so easily that it would be natural to worry about potential information abuse or misuse. For people who want to decrease the likelihood of legal controversies in web scraping, it is important to identify the legal risks around web scraping.\n\nHere comes the ultimate question: to scrape or not to scrape? Is web scraping illegal or not? What are the potential legal implications of using web scraping? Unfortunately, there is no short answer to these questions. Due to the relative novelty of web scraping in a legal context, the line between legitimate and evil use of this technique is still hard to define in most countries. For a decade or so, web scraping was only guided by a set of related, fundamental legal theories and laws, such as:\n\nIn most countries, law enforcement specifically for web scraping is not clearly defined yet. However, with the onset of GDPR regulations, more and more people have realized the need to comply with legal standards before proceeding with a scraping project to avoid falling into a tricky legal situation. As international legal circumstances vary widely, this part only discusses the legal risks of web scraping in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe Case of the United States\n\nIn the US, the law regarding web scraping is still developing and implicates a large number of statutory regimes and areas of common law. There are major types of legal claims that website owners can use to avoid undesired web scraping. For example, web-scraping activity may implicate federal statutes, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and insider trading laws; state blue sky laws; privacy laws; and common law claims, such as breach of contract, fraud, and trespass to chattels.\n\nCFAA\n\nThe CFAA proscribes “intentionally access[ing] a computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access, and thereby obtain[ing] … information from any protected computer.” Courts have disagreed, however, on what constitutes access without authorization or exceeding authorization.\n\nIn hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp., the court claims that a user’s act of accessing data made available by the owner to the general public does not constitute access “without authorization” under the CFAA. Yet in Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., the court held that a user accesses a computer “without authorization” when he or she continues to circumvent technological measures employed by the operator to block that user’s access.\n\nSome significant court decisions in 2020 also bear on whether scraping data that one is authorized to access for certain purposes – such as browsing as a potential customer or participating as a member of a social media network – but not authorized to access for web-scraping purposes, constitutes a breach of the CFAA. We are not going to elaborate on that in this article. In short, although the scope of the CFAA’s access provision is unsettled, a significant authority suggests that the scraping of publicly available information, such as from LinkedIn member profiles, does not violate the CFAA. Likewise, it suggests that violation of a website’s terms of use alone, without more, may not violate the CFAA.\n\nCopyright/DMCA\n\nThe operator of a website that is the target of web scraping may bring a claim for copyright infringement against the user of the web-scraping device by proving:\n\nAt least one federal court has held that a party faces liability under Section 1201(a)(1)(A) of the DMCA when it uses bots to circumvent security measures that control nonhuman access to copyrighted material on a webpage.\n\nIt is also worth noting the general copyright principle that, although compilations of facts can be protected by copyright, authors may not copyright their ideas or the facts they narrate. Accordingly, if the data scraped are purely facts without a creative component, then there is no copyright claim.\n\nPrivacy Statutes\n\nWeb scraping may also implicate the privacy statutes of states and other jurisdictions. For example, the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 grant consumers a variety of rights and protections with respect to their personal information. Web-scraping activity that compiles personally identifiable information could implicate a variety of privacy statutes – and potentially subject a web scraper to government and private litigation.\n\nInsider Trading\n\nUnder certain circumstances, web scraping could also potentially violate federal insider trading law or state blue sky laws. For example, using affirmative misrepresentations to obtain material nonpublic information through web scraping and then trading based on that information could potentially constitute insider trading.\n\nHowever, the law in this area is unsettled, and it remains to be seen how strict an approach regulators and law enforcement may take when deciding what constitutes a breach of duty or deception in the web-scraping context.\n\nBreach of contract\n\nIn addition to the boundaries imposed by the statutes discussed above, a plaintiff could seek to invoke various common law remedies in an attempt to stem or curtail web scraping. For instance, some website operators have attempted to assert claims for breach of contract against alleged web scrapers. Courts, however, have held that defendants must be on notice of a website’s terms of service for the terms to be enforced against them.\n\nThe Case of Europe\n\nToday 69% of the population above the age of 16 in the EU have heard about the GDPR and 71% of people heard about their national data protection authority, according to results published in a survey from the EU Fundamental Rights Agency. Though still in its infancy, the GDPR is one of the most comprehensive and impactful data protection laws to date. It has radically changed how businesses scrape the web in Europe. If your scraping project needs you to scrape PIIs, to avoid hefty fines, it is better to make sure you’re GDPR-compliant. See our blog on GDPR: GDPR Compliance In Web Scraping, which covers almost everything you need to know about GDPR.\n\n6 Tips for Doing Web Scraping Properly\n\nOn the whole, the law on web scraping is still developing, and only further court decisions and legal pronouncements will thoroughly define its parameters. To avoid being involved in lawsuits, the following is a non-exhaustive list of practical tips for users who have engaged in web scraping.\n\n1. Respect and follow the Terms of Service.\n\nAlways review the website’s Terms of Services (ToS) and robot.txt files before consenting to web scraping data collection activity. If possible, get prior permission from the owner of the website.\n\n2. Scrape at a reasonable and moderate rate.\n\nBe gentle and don’t be aggressive. Give the scraped website some breathing space. When you’re scraping, you should hit the website within a reasonable time interval and keep the number of requests in control. Avoid adversely impacting a website’s physical operation, which could lead to a claim for trespass to chattels or similar claims.\n\n3. Monitor and consider any actions a website takes to restrict web scraping.\n\nIf a website clearly restricts your web scraping activities with various anti-scraping measures, such as the use of CAPTCHAs, rate limits, blocking of IP addresses, etc., you need to be cautious of potential legal risks. Be prepared to stop if asked to do so through a cease-and-desist letter or otherwise.\n\n4. Avoid collecting personally identifiable information.\n\nConsider whether any data to be scraped belongs to the PII of EU citizens. You can only scrape these data with one of the five reasons below:\n\n5. Consider whether any data to be scraped is protected by copyright.\n\nDon’t scrape the copyrighted or patented data because you could be involved with copyright infringement.\n\n6. Make good use of the scraped data.\n\nDon’t share the scraped data randomly with others. Use data wisely to generate more insights and help improve your business.\n\nWrap-up\n\nWeb scraping itself is not illegal, but people need to be careful with how to use this technique even though there are still a lot of gray areas around law enforcement of web scraping. A negative answer to all the questions now does not necessarily give a clearance to proceed with the scraping project in the future. It is wise to stay up to date on evolving laws in this area. If you are hesitating about whether to scrape a certain website, a safer way to do it is to consult a lawyer for advice.\n\nIn addition, it is extremely important to make an informed choice of your web scraping tools if you want to lower your legal risks. Consider using popular web scraping tools like Octoparse. It has a large user base and only processes or shares data based on the five legal bases mentioned above.

    "context": "How to Scrape Data from Craigslist\n\nAbigail Jones June 17, 2024 5 min read\n\nWhy Scrape Craigslist Data\n\nCraigslist gathers an extensive array of information. Without a doubt, it is definitely one of the popular websites to scrape. Why? Here are some of the most typical reasons.\n\n1. Structure data is more convenient\n\nIndividuals can extract first-hand information about houses, cars, computers, and many more. When exported into Excel sheets, it is much easier for them to look through and compare the data.\n\n2. Gathering sale leads\n\nCraigslist, similar to Yellowpages, is full of potential business leads for revenue generation. No doubt that leads are important, especially qualified ones. This is probably the reason why Craigslist appeals to so many people.\n\n3. Gain profits by reselling goods\n\nWith scraped data in a good structure, people can better analyze prices and set new ones for reselling. However, reselling is rather in the gray area, thus this might not be a good try. It’s profitable sometimes, but the consequences may not be delightful.\n\n4. Monitor competitors\n\nCraigslist is full of precious information covering an array of industries where people can keep track of their competitors. Being informed of their strategies in real-time will help businesses gain an edge in competition.\n\nIs It Legal to Scrape Craigslist\n\nAs one of the most popular websites out there to scrape, Craigslist has proved to be one of the toughest ones. The reason is simple: unlike websites that provide users with APIs to get data, Craigslist API is not aimed at pulling data off. Quite on the contrary, it is used for posting data on Craigslist.\n\nJust like Facebook and LinkedIn, Craigslist’s terms clearly state that all sorts of robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, and crawlers are prohibited.\n\nCraigslist has used various technologies and legal practices to prevent being scraped for commercial purposes. In fact, in April 2017, Craigslist obtained a $60.5 million judgment against 3 Taps Inc, a company that is accused of scraping real estate listings. A few months later, Craigslist reached another $31 million judgment with Instamotor, claiming that Instamotor’s car listing service was scraped from Craigslist, and they sent unsolicited emails to Craigslist users for promotional purposes.\n\nNevertheless, as explained in the article “10 Myths about Web Scraping“, it is illegal if you scrape confidential information for profit, but if you scrape public data discreetly for personal use, you should be fine.\n\nHow to Scrape Data from Craigslist\n\nMethod 1: Scrape Craigslist with Python\n\nIf you are a coder, you can check out this Scrapy tutorial to learn to crawl Craigslist’s “Architecture & Engineering” jobs in New York and store the data in a CSV file.\n\nMethod 2: Extract Craigslist data by preset template\n\nBut the problem with the above tutorials is obvious: they are way too complicated for non-coders. If you have zero coding experience and want a simple and quick method, here’s a catch – use an automated data scraping tool like Octoparse.\n\nOctoparse provides a preset Craigslist data scraping template that can help you extract Craigslist data including post address, title, price, etc. Click the link below and preview the data sample, you can try it from the webpage for free.\n\nhttps://www.octoparse.com/template/craigslist-scraper\n\nScrap Craiglist Without Coding\n\nBesides the preset templates, Octoparse also provides advanced functions that allow you to customize your scraping workflow. With the power of data scraping, we can extract all the info we want from Craigslist listings within clicks and export them into Excel, CSV, HTML, and/or databases easily. In this part, you can learn how to extract Craigslist real estate listings within 3 steps using Octoparse.\n\nIn this case, let’s scrape the housing real estate for sale in Chicago. The target Craigslist URL:\n\nhttps://chicago.craigslist.org/d/housing-real-estate/search/rea?lang=en&cc=gb\n\nBefore starting, please download Octoparse on your device, and launch it to create a free account.\n\nStep 1: Enter the target Craigslist URL to build a crawler\n\nEnter the listing URL into the box, and Octoparse will start detecting the page data automatically. As you can see, the data to be extracted is highlighted in red, and the preview section below allows you to pre-edit the data fields.\n\nStep 2: Customize the data extraction settings\n\nAfter making sure that the data fields are what we want, click “Save settings” and Octoparse will auto-generate a scraping workflow on the left-hand side.\n\nStep 3: Run the extraction to get data\n\nFinally, you only need to save the crawler and hit “Run” to start extraction. The scraping process can be done within 5 minutes. And you can download the scraped data in an Excel or CSV file, or export to your database directly.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter reading this article, you’d have a general idea of scraping Craigslist now. Choose the method that is most suitable for you according to your needs.\n\nIf you want to save time and effort, Octoparse will be a better choice for you. Please note that even though this article guides you through extracting Craigslist data, you should always respect its Terms of Service and scrape at a moderate frequency.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

However, you should always obey the copyright-protected policy like Twitter Developer Policy and personal data regulation. The usage of your scraped data is your responsibility, you should pay attention to your local law. Read the web scraping legacy problem to learn more about this question.\n\nIf you still feel at risk about the legality or compliance, you can try Twitter API. It offers access to Twitter for advanced users who know about programming. You can get information like Tweets, Direct Messages, Spaces, Lists, users, and more.\n\nTwitter Scraper: Scrape Tweets with Quick and Painless Templates\n\nIn July 2023, Twitter rebranded as X, replacing the iconic blue bird logo. While twitter.com remains active, x.com now redirects to it. The change sparked heated discussions online, with trending tags like #Xeet and #TwitterX.\n\nSo, what do you think about Twitter rebranding to X, and what do other people say about it? You may be wandering how to scrape data from twitter. Here are three tips to get started with Octoparse, the best web scraping tool offering diverse templates for you to choose from.\n\nTip 1: Scrape Comments from a Tweet\n\nElon Musk’s latest tweet says “Our headquarters tonight” and has almost 40k comments now. And the previous video about the new logo he tweeted has 47.5k comments already. These replies offer rich insights into public sentiment and trending discussions around the change.\n\nWith Octoparse, you can scrape replies to those tweets in two ways: • Manually scraping all comments and replies by the Tweet URL and start a custom task • Use a ready-made template: Twitter (X) Comments Scraper Social Media Scrape tweet content, author, tweet post time, reply content, reply sender, reply time, etc from Twitter by search result URL.\n\nhttps://www.octoparse.com/template/tweets-comments-scraper-by-search-result-url\n\nTip 2: Scrape Tweets by Hashtag\n\nYou can scrape all the tweets under a specific hashtag, like #Xeet. You can find the Tweets scraper by hashtag on Octoparse, which is named Tweets details by hashtag_Twitter.\n\nTwitter Scraper (by hashtag) Social Media Scrape the latest tweet content, the number of reply, repost, like, view, etc. from Twitter by hashtags.\n\nIt lets you extract various information including the tweet URLs, author names and accounts, post time, image or video content, likes. Or you can scrape the tweets manually by setting up a customed workflow.\n\nTip 3: Scrape Twitter Search Results by Keyword\n\nIf the above tips can’t meet your needs, you can search for a keyword yourself and download the search results. Similarly, you can use a preset template provided by Octoparse, named Tweets details by search result URL_Twitter. Or you can follow the steps below to scrape tweets yourself.\n\nTwitter Advanced Search Scraper Social Media Scrape tweet content, the number of reply, repost, like, view etc. from Twitter by advanced search.\n\nTwitter Scraper: Extract Data from X Without Coding\n\nAfter learning about the specific templates for Twitter data scraping, you can also try Octoparse software for free. It’s also easy to use with the AI-based auto-detecting function, which means you can extract data from Twitter without coding skills.\n\nOctoparse also supports a wide range of advanced scraping functions, including:\n\nThe public data like account profiles, tweets, hashtags, comments, likes, etc. can be exported as Excel, CSV, Google Sheets, SQL, or streamed into a database in real-time via Octoparse. Download Octoparse and follow the easy steps below to build a free web crawler for Twitter.\n\nStep 1: Input Twitter URL and Log into Tiwtter\n\nEach task strats with telling Octoparse what website you target. Here are several steps guiding you to do so:\n\nDirect access to followers and following lists is prohibited on Twitter unless you have first logged in.\n\nNow that we’ve successfully saved the login credentials in the task workflow, when we execute the task, our Twitter account will be logged in.\n\nStep 2: Set up Pagination\n\nAs you can see, the website is loaded in the built-in browser. Usually, many websites have a “next page” button that allows Octoparse to click on and go to each page to grab more information.\n\nIn this case, however, Twitter applies an “infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.\n\nSo the final extraction process will work like this: Octoparse will scroll down the page a little, extract the tweets, scroll down a bit, extract, and so on and so forth.\n\nStep 3: Build a loop item\n\nTo tell the crawler to scroll down the page repetitively, we can build a pagination loop by clicking on the blank area and clicking “loop click single element” on the Tips panel. As you can see here, a pagination loop is shown in the workflow area, this means that we’ve set up pagination successfully. Then we can start extracting data. Lets’ break down this step further:\n\nBut we want to extract different data fields into separate columns instead of just one, so we need to modify the extraction settings to select our target data manually. It is very easy to do this:\n\nNow, our final step awaits.\n\nStep 4: Modify the pagination settings and run the Twitter crawler\n\nWe’ve built a pagination loop earlier, but we still need a little modification on the workflow setting:\n\nYou can now run the crawler on your local device to get the data, or run it on Octoparse Cloud servers to schedule your runs and save your local resource.\n\n💡 Note: If some fields appear blank in your extracted data, it usually means there was no corresponding content on the page for that field — so nothing was scraped.\n\nVideo tutorial: Scrape Twitter data for sentiment analysis\n\nTwitter Data Scraping with Python\n\nYou can scrape Twitter using Python if you’re good at coding. There are some accesses like Tweepy or Twint that you need to use during the process.\n\nYou need to create a Twitter Developer Account and apply for API access, it only allows you to get tweets on a limitation.\n\nTwint allows you to scrape tweets without number limitation, you can learn more from this article on how to use Twint Python to scrape tweets.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nNow, you have a general idea of Twitter web scraping with both coding and no-coding methods. Choose the one that is most suitable for your needs. However, Octoparse is always the best choice if you want to save time or energy.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. Which Twitter scraper offers the most data points per profile in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, Octoparse stands out as the Twitter scraper providing the richest data per profile, including tweets, user info, likes, retweets, comments, follower counts, images and more. Unlike API-based solutions with strict limits, Octoparse offers unlimited, no-code data extraction ideal for marketers and analysts.\n\n2. How does no-code Twitter scraping compare to API-based methods?\n\nAPI methods provide official, structured data access but come with rate limits and need developer expertise. For non-technical users needing scalable public data, no-code scraping is often more practical. If you feel troublesome using Twitter scraper API, it is a good option to use no-code Twitter scraping tools like Octoparse that allow users to extract large volumes of public Twitter data quickly and easily—no programming or API keys required.\n\n3. What are the legal and ethical considerations for Twitter data scraping?\n\nWhen scraping Twitter, always collect public data only and respect Twitter’s Terms of Service. Comply with local privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA, and ensure ethical use of data.\n\n4. How can I automate Twitter scraping for large-scale data collection?\n\nUse tools like Octoparse that support auto-detection, auto-login, cloud scraping, scheduled tasks, IP rotation, CAPTCHA solving and more. This lets you run large-scale, automated Twitter scraping reliably without coding at ease.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

    "context": "How to Do a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Correctly\n\nAbigail Jones July 28, 2025 5 min read\n\n#Step1: How to Gather Twitter Data\n\nWhen we think of sentiment analysis, we often first consider how to efficiently collect and analyze vast volumes of textual data from diverse sources.\n\nAs noted by experts in natural language processing, the ability to extract meaningful insights from large-scale datasets is fundamental to understanding public opinion and consumer behavior.\n\nTake one of the most popular social media websites Twitter as an example.\n\nThere are several methods that we can crawl data from Twitter:\n\nAnalyze Tweets with API\n\nFirst, it is well known that Twitter provides public APIs for developers to read and write tweets conveniently.\n\nThe REST API identifies Twitter applications and users using OAuth. Thus, we can utilize twitter REST APIs to get the most recent and popular tweets.\n\nTwitter4j is imported to crawl twitter data through twitter REST API.\n\nTwitter data can be crawled according to a specific time range, location, or other data fields. The data crawled will be returned as JSON format. Note that APP developers need to generate twitter application accounts, so as to get the authorized access to twitter API.\n\nBy using a specific Access Token, the application made a request to the POST OAuth2 to exchange credentials so that users can get authenticated access to the REST API.\n\nThis mechanism allows us to pull users’ information from the data resource. Then we can use the search function to crawl these structured tweets related to university topics.\n\nThen, I generated a query set to crawl tweets, displayed as the figure below. I collected University Ranking data of USNews 2016, which includes 244 universities and their rankings. Then, I customized the data fields I need to use for crawling tweets into JSON format.\n\nIn this case, I extracted 462,413 tweets results totally. The number of most universities’ tweets crawled is less than 2000.\n\nGet it With a Web Scraping Tool\n\nAPI may not be familiar to everyone and could be tricky for someone without any coding skills.\n\nFor your reference, I’d like to propose an automated web crawler tools that can help you crawl websites without any coding skills, like Octoparse.\n\nIf you need help to gather Twitter data with Octoparse:\n\n> Scraping Twitter Use Guide\n\n#Step2: Twitter Sentiment Analysis\n\nLet’s go back to the University Ranking of my designed application.\n\nRanking technology in my application is to parse tweets crawled from Twitter and then rank related tweets according to their relevance to a specific university. I want to filter high-related tweets (topK) to do the Sentiment Analysis, which will avoid trivial tweets that make our results inaccurate.\n\nYou can rank them based on TF-IDF similarity, text summarization, spatial and temporal factors, or you can choose the machine learning ranking method.\n\nEven Twitter itself provides a method based on time or popularity. However, we need a more advanced method that can filter out the most spam and trivial tweets.\n\nIn order to measure the trust and popularity of a tweet, I use the following features from tweets: retweet counts, follower counts, and friend counts.\n\nAssuming that a trust tweet should be posted by a trust user. And a trust user should have enough friends and followers, then a popular tweet should have high retweet-count.\n\nI build a model combining trust and popularity (TP Score) for a tweet. Then I rank those tweets based on TP score. Note that report news usually has a high retweet count, and this type of score will be useless for our Sentiment Analysis.\n\nThus, I assigned a relatively lower weight on this portion when computing the TP score. The formula designed is shown below. The tweets we crawled are filtered by query words and posting time. All we need is to consider the retweet counts, follower counts, friend counts.\n\nI make my own university ranking according to public reputation which is represented by sentiment score.\n\nHowever, public reputation is only one of the factors that should be considered when evaluating a university. Thus, I want to present an overall ranking that combines both commercial ranking and our ranking.\n\nThere are three main types of tweets texts:\n\nSentiment Score: The Sentiment Score is calculated for public reputation. The positive rate of each university was used as the sentiment score for the public reputation ranking. The formula below defines the positive rate. Note that the negative polarity is not considered since it is equal to zero.\n\nWhere n is the total number of tweets for each university; And represents the positive polarity for a tweet, 4.\n\nAfter I complete Sentiment Analysis, I would proceed to build a classifier for Sentiment Analysis using a machine learning algorithm. I will discuss it in the next article regarding the Maximum Entropy classifier.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

    "context": "Indeed Scraper: How to Scrape Indeed Job Postings Easily\n\nAbigail Jones April 15, 2024 3 min read\n\nDoes Indeed Allow Web Scraping\n\nYes, Indeed allows scraping where the job data from the site can be extracted using Indeed API. The data extracted can be used for Indeed analyzing data assessments. Though using Indeed API manual data extraction can be done, the process is not only time-consuming, and hassle, but also expensive. Here, a third-party data scraper works as a cost-effective and easier method to get the desired data from the site. But you should pay attention to avoiding personal data collection and illegal data usage.\n\nScrape Indeed Data Like Jobs, Salaries, and Company Reviews\n\nUsing a professional scraping tool allows quick data extraction from Indeed, we suggest Octoparse. The software works on both Windows and Mac systems. It allows extracting almost all needed data from Indeed like jobs, salaries, reviews of the companies, etc. You can also use the advanced functions with AJAX, XPath, infinite scrolling, pagination, Cloud service, IP rotation, etc. Or you can just use the auto-detection mode or the preset Indeed templates to finish the process almost automatically.\n\nSteps for Indeed web scraping with Octoparse\n\nStep 1: Launch Octoparse and paste the Indeed site link\n\nOpen Octoparse after you have downloaded and installed it on your device. Paste the link you need to scrape from Indeed to the main interface of Octoparse and proceed.\n\nStep 2: Customize workflow with pagination\n\nYou’ll enter the auto-detect mode by default, you can cancel if you want to set the advanced mode. Anyway, create a workflow and you can set the pagination if you need to scrape multiple pages. Modify the XPath of each element if needed.\n\nStep 3: Get job posting data from Indeed\n\nFinally, click on the Run button to start scraping the Indeed data, and you can download the file in Excel or CSV format as you like. If you want to check the detailed steps, you can move to Octoparse Indeed Data Scraping Guide or watch the video tutorial below.\n\nIndeed preset scraping template\n\nYou can also choose the preset data scraping templates from Octoparse. These scraping templates are designed for popular websites, and you can get data within a few clicks. For Indeed, you can extract job details like location, description, post time, etc. by URL listing or keyword. Launch Octoparse and find it from the Templates panel, or click on the online Indeed scraper below to have a try.\n\nIndeed Job Listing Scraper Jobs Get job details (location, description, post time, etc.) from Indeed.\n\nScraping Indeed Job Postings with Python\n\nPython is a versatile programming language that can be used for multiple tasks and if you are good with using the language and creating codes, Python can also be used for scraping Indeed job postings.\n\nTo extract Indeed data, we would use Beautiful Soup (bs4) which is a Python library for getting the data from HTML and XML files. Since the module is not built-in with Python, the below-given command will help in its installation.\n\npip install bs4\n\nNext, for sending the HTTP/1.1, a request command is to be given\n\npip install requests\n\nNext, comes the step for importing the requested modules and requesting the URL to get a response.\n\nrequests. Get (URL, args)\n\nNext, convert the data into HTML code and then Parse the HTML content using bs4.\n\nSyntax: soup = BeautifulSoup (r. content, ‘html5lib’)\n\nParameters:\n\nr. content: It is the raw HTML content.\n\nFinally, the code has to be used for data extraction.\n\nNow, you can get the job posting data from Indeed easily with the 2 methods above. One is using Octoparse without coding, and the other is using Python which asks for coding knowledge. No matter which one you choose, hope that your problem can be solved.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

These enable:\n\nExample:\n\nYou can choose to scrape store details by URL, listing pages, or keywords.\n\nGoogle Maps Listings Scraper (by Keywords) Maps Scrape store information (title, address, geographical information, etc.) from Google Maps.\n\nYou can also only scrape the reviews or the contact details with Octoparse’s Google Maps Contact Scraper templates.\n\nGoogle Maps Email Finder Maps Scrape the place's website, phone, email, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, name, rating, review count, etc. from Google Maps by keywords and locations.\n\nJust preview the data sample and finish the scraping by entering several keywords (e.g., “Italian restaurants in Austin, TX”) or a Google Maps URL, then run the scraper and extract complete business profiles in minutes..\n\nVideo tutorial: Extracting store info from Google Maps\n\nWhat Data Can You Scrape from Google Maps\n\nGoogle Maps is one of the most powerful mapping tools on the web to gather information about businesses, schools, restaurants, stores, etc. It is a source of useful information for people who want to get an idea about a place, location, or business.\n\nGoogle Maps scraping unlocks access to rich datasets including:\n\nThis Google Maps business data powers powerful market segmentation, lead list building, and detailed local market research—all easily exportable into Excel sheets or CSV.\n\nBenefits of Scraping Google Maps Data\n\nGoogle Maps data can be extremely valuable to online marketers and digital service providers, who can use them to approach businesses and promote their services. So, It is one of the most effective ways to generate leads and reach out to more customers. It can also help people who are seeking the best places or businesses in their local area.\n\nHere are a range of benefits for businesses looking to streamline their operations, enhance their marketing strategies, and gain a competitive edge in the market.\n\nThe Benefits of Scraping Google Maps Data for Businesses\n\nIs It Legal to Scrape Google Maps in 2025?\n\nGoogle Maps discourages web scraping and does not allow scraping its content for use outside the Google Map Service, according to Google Maps terms and conditions.\n\nHowever, scraping publicly available data from any site including Google Maps is completely legal as it does not violate any privacy rights of Google Maps.\n\nGoogle Maps also provides an API for users to access the data about Google places details, routes, and maps. With Google Maps API, developers can get data from all the businesses listed in Google Maps using HTTP requests via API.\n\nIn general:\n\nScraping publicly available business data from Google Maps (such as names, addresses, and ratings) is generally legal in many regions, as long as you avoid collecting personal or restricted information and respect Google’s terms of service\n\nGoogle’s policies and anti-scraping protections have become stricter in 2025, so always use responsible extraction practices, respect rate limits, and comply with local privacy and data laws (such as GDPR and CCPA updates), especially those seeking to achieve bulk Google Maps data export or local business data extraction via scraping should stay informed of evolving regulations around data privacy\n\nFor more detailed discussions about the legal landscape of web scraping and recent developments, check our in-depth article on the legacy problem about web scraping.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Google Maps Scraping Issues in 2025\n\n1. Handling Anti-Scraping Mechanisms Google Maps uses CAPTCHAs, request throttling, and IP detection. Use rotating residential proxies, delay tactics, and browser simulation to avoid blocks.\n\n2.

    "context": "How to Scrape eBay Listings Without Coding\n\nAnsel Barrett December 19, 2023 6 min read\n\nWhat Data to Scrape from eBay Listings\n\neBay’s listings contain a wealth of product information. You can gain a basic understanding of each product on the listing pages, and most of this can be extracted. Some key data points you can retrieve, like product details, pricing information, seller information, and shipping options, as below:\n\nWhy Scraping eBay Listings\n\nAs mentioned above, eBay listings offer information about products in diverse dimensions. You can benefit from scraping this data in many ways.\n\nSave time and effort\n\nThere are countless pieces of information on eBay listings. Due to its time-consuming and tedious nature, manual data collection is out of the question. Also, collecting data by hand might lead to errors in data. By contrast, web scraping pull data from eBay listings is more time-saving and effortless. You can automate the process and gain large amounts of data in a fraction of the time and avoid doing error correction.\n\nProvide valuable materials for market research\n\neBay product listings can offer valuable data for market research purposes. Scraping eBay data provides businesses and individuals who want to analyze pricing trends, product availability, or demand for specific items an effective way to get the raw materials they need to gain insights about market conditions.\n\nMake competitive pricing strategies\n\nWhile making a purchase decision, buyers always look for the best deal, so the price is the first consideration. But what price is more competitive among all the products and more reasonable for potential buyers? To answer this question, you need the help of eBay listings data. You can compare prices across different sellers by scraping eBay listings. Then, you can understand which price range is more attractive to consumers and modify your pricing strategies.\n\nImprove products and find new opportunities\n\nOn eBay listings, you can easily find popular or trending products. By looking at these items, you can determine what kinds of products are popular and preferred by consumers. With such data, you can determine which products are in high demand, which products you are outperforming, and which products you should modify and launch in the future. These will bring new opportunities for your businesses to grow.\n\nYou can read the article about eBay marketing strategies to learn more tips and improve your eBay business.\n\nScrape eBay Listings with eBay API\n\neBay provides users with a series of free APIs. If you want to get eBay API access, you’ll have to create an eBay developer account and wait for the eBay team to check and approve your account to get access to your developer account and get eBay API.\n\nAPIs on eBay are divided into several categories, including Buy, Sell, Commerce, etc., but eBay has limits for API calls due to the heavy load. For example, the Inventory API under Sell APIs is limited to 2 million API calls per day. Additionally, eBay listing data returned by the API is filtered and restricted to protect sellers.\n\nUsers without coding expertise may find APIs difficult to use due to coding requirements and integration processes. Fortunately, there is a great alternative for those users – web scraping.\n\n4 Steps to Build An eBay Product Scraper\n\nOctoparse offers a method to scrape eBay data regardless of coding experience. It can also access the full HTML of eBay listing pages, which allows you to collect more comprehensive information. In this part, we’ll walk you through how to scrape eBay listings with web scraping tools in only several clicks!\n\nBefore we move forward, please download Octoparse and install it on your local device first. Octoparse is a no-coding web scraping tool for anyone. You can build your own eBay listing scraper with it by only clicking on your mouse. When you first open this software, you’ll need an account to log in. You can sign up for a free account and log in to unlock the powerful scraping features.\n\nStep 1: Create a new task for scraping eBay listings\n\nIf you have a product listing page on eBay that you want to scrape data from, copy the URL and paste it into the search bar on Octoparse. Then click “Start” to create a new web scraping task.\n\nStep 2: Auto-detect data of eBay product data\n\nAfter the target finishes loading in the built-in browser, you can use the smart detection feature in Octoparse to catch the data you need!\n\nClick “Auto-detect webpage data” in the Tips panel, then Octoparse will scan the page and try its best to “guess” what data you’d like to extract. Then it’ll highlight all detected data inside the browser for you. You can check if it made a good “guess” and preview all data fields on the “Data Preview” panel at the bottom.\n\nStep 3: Create and modify the workflow\n\nWhen you make sure you’ve selected all the needed data, click “Create the workflow”. Then a scraping workflow will be auto-generated on the right-hand side. It’s a flow chart that shows the process of data scraping. Click on each step on the chart, then you can check if it works properly, and add or remove any unwanted steps. Meanwhile, you can edit the data fields, like renaming them or deleting unwanted data, directly in the data preview section.\n\nStep 4: Run the task and export eBay listings data\n\nOnce you’ve double-checked all the details of the scraper, click on the Run button. Now, you can choose to run your scraping task on your local devices or in the Cloud. While eBay listings are ever-changing, if you aim to get the latest data, handing the scraper over to Octoparse’s cloud servers and scheduling it to run automatically can be your first choice. Cloud servers can process scraping tasks around the clock at a faster pace and feed you up-to-date information on eBay.\n\nWhen the scraping process is completed, you can export the extracted data to Excel or to a database like Google Sheets for further use. For example, you can clean and analyze data from eBay listings to monitor your competitors and conduct market research.\n\nOctoparse also provides template presets for eBay listings. It’s even an easier way to scrape eBay data, since you do not need to build a scraper anymore. Since the workflow is preset, you can only type in several necessary parameters to launch the scraper directly. You can search eBay on Octoparse to find the templates and preview the data samples, or try the online eBay data scraping template directly.\n\neBay Scraper (Store Listing) E-Commerce Scrape store name, store URL, store title, price, condition, number of followers, and sales from eBay by store page URL.\n\nIf you have any questions about the above steps, hope the guide on Scraping Data from Both Listing and Detail Pages can help. Or you can find more tools for eBay data web scraping.\n\nWrap-up\n\nWhen someone is new to e-commerce or eBay, it might be hard to master the rules. At this moment, referring to others’ products or content is one of the best ways to understand the market and create one listing. For people who have been involved in this industry for a long time, eBay listings are valuable to catch the market trends and improve their eBay product listings. With Octoparse, anyone can gain wanted data from eBay listings in an easy-to-use way.\n\nOf course, web scraping is not restricted to eBay but can be applied to other e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Lazada, etc., monitoring and cross-contrasting data from diverse platforms might give you new ideas about the whole market.

    "context": "How to Scrape Data from Amazon without Coding Skills\n\nAbigail Jones September 4, 2024 6 min read\n\nWhat Types of Product Data Can Be Scraped\n\nAlmost everything about products is available for scraping on Amazon. On product listing pages, you can scrape product information, including:\n\nTake WATCH as an example, you can collect the product name, sponsored state, ASIN, rating, current price, etc. All these public data can be scraped into structured files. After that, with some other visual analysis tools, you can quickly analyze the product and optimize your listings to attract more customers.\n\nWhy Scraping Amazon Product Data\n\nSo, here comes the question of why it is important to scrape product information from Amazon into structured data. Before starting with the how-to steps, you can learn about the benefits of scraping Amazon product data and the difficulties you may encounter.\n\n1. Monitor your competitors to keep competitive\n\nAlways keeping an eye on your competitors on Amazon will help you stay one step ahead in the market.\n\nScraping and analyzing data on competitor products like pricing, description, reviews, and ratings can contribute to real-time market intelligence, so that you can identify what’s working for them and your target consumers, then adapt your own product listing accordingly.\n\n2. Catch the market trends\n\nThe market is ever-changing nowadays. By collecting and analyzing data from thousands of Amazon products over time, you can get valuable insight into emerging trends, popular brands, engaging keywords, changes in consumer demand, etc., and use this info to determine if you need to launch products or improve services to meet shifting market needs.\n\n3. Optimize your Amazon marketing strategy\n\nImproving search position is important not only on Google, but also on Amazon. To improve Amazon search positions and marketing strategies, you still need the help of Amazon product data. Product titles and descriptions from your competitors’ listings can reveal what keywords and strategies are most effective. Pricing strategies, promotion techniques, key phrases, images, etc., can all drive sales. You can analyze such data to compare your KPIs, and adjust accordingly to improve click-through and conversion rates.\n\n4. Improve your products and services\n\nConsumers’ feedback is a mirror that reflects how they think about the products they buy and the services they enjoy. By paying attention to their reviews and feedback on similar Amazon products, you can learn what they want most and improve your offerings accordingly. Also, Amazon data scraping reveals specific feature requests, complaints, and competing product strengths that you can incorporate to enhance your value proposition.\n\nDifficulties and Solutions in Scraping Amazon\n\nWhile using product scrapers to pull data from Amazon, you might meet some challenges, because they have implemented anti-scraping measures to managing scraping attempts at different scales. However, these measures are very common on a lot of platforms.\n\nTo maximize your chances of successfully harvesting all the data you need on an ongoing basis, you need to understand these measures and the anti-scraping approaches you can use to overcome them.\n\nBesides the difficulties above, you might face more complicated situations while scraping Amazon data due to frequent changes in their site structure and stricter anti-scraping measures.\n\nBelow are some other approaches you can consider:\n\nDon’t be intimidated by the complicated solutions listed there. If you scrape a top 100 product under one category just a few times, you might not need it. You might happily get the data without any problems, and you have a range of tools to choose from.\n\nBut if you need high-frequency data with a huge amount of data volume or your desired data points are rarely popular, you might need to consider more comprehensive features.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Amazon web scraping legacy and difficulties, you can keep reading this article: Is It Legal to Scrape Amazon Data.\n\n3 Methods to Scrape Amazon Product Data\n\nNext, you can learn three different ways to extract product data from Amazon, no matter coding or no-coding. Choose the one that is most suitable for you.\n\nMethod 1: online Amazon product data templates\n\nThe easiest method to extract product information from Amazon is using a preset template. Octoparse provides such data scraping templates for Amazon and other popular sites, with which you can get Amazon product data without any coding but just entering a few parameters. What’s more, these data templates can work from your browser, so you don’t need to download any software. Try this Amazon product scraper below to scrape data like title, brand, star rating, reviews, price, stock, color, etc.\n\nhttps://www.octoparse.com/template/amazon-product-details-scraper\n\nMethod 2: build Amazon product data crawler without coding\n\nThe data templates have already set the scraping paths already, so you cannot make any changes. Choose Octoparse and create a crawler by yourself to meet all your scraping needs. It’s easy-to-use, and with the AI-based auto-detecting function and point-and-click interface, you can finish the scraping without any coding skills. Octoparse also offers advanced functions like IP proxy, CAPTCHA solving, cloud service, etc. to help you get more data. Download Octoparse and follow the easy steps below to customize your Amazon product crawler.\n\nSteps to Scrape Amazon Product List Using Octoparse\n\nSteps 1: Paste Amazon product page URL to Octoparse and start auto-scraping\n\nDownload, install, and sign up for an account for free in Octoparse. Then copy the Amazon product page URL you need to scrape and paste it to the main interface of Octoparse, the auto-detect mode will start.\n\nSteps 2: Customize the data fields\n\nCreate a workflow after the quick auto-detect. You can make more customized options like Pagination, Loop, and modify the data fields. Just finish all operations by clicking and dragging-and-dropping.\n\nSteps 3: Download Amazon product data into Excel\n\nOnce you have selected all wanted data fields and ensured the workflow works well, click on the “Run” button and select a running mode for your task. Finally, you can export the scraped data as local files like Excel, CSV, HTML, etc., or to databases like Google Sheets.\n\nYou can check out more details from the How to Scrape product information from Amazon tutorial if you still have any questions.\n\nMethod 3: Scrape Amazon Data by Programming\n\nIf you are a programmer and want to communicate with Amazon.com with a script, there are multiple APIs you could utilize to get Amazon data. What you need is just to code to connect to the API and easily download the data.\n\nAmazon Product Advertising API is one of them. It is a web service and application programming interface that gives application programmers access to Amazon’s product catalog data. It is officially provided by Amazon and free to use. This API opens the doors to Amazon’s databases for users to retrieve detailed product information, reviews, and images so that they can take advantage of Amazon’s sophisticated e-commerce data and functionality.\n\nBut like most APIs, the API doesn’t provide all the information on the product page. To get those data or to realize other scraping needs such as price monitoring, you can program your own customized Amazon web scraper using Python or other languages.\n\nBuilding a web scraper needs professional coding knowledge and is also time-consuming. For non-coders or programmers who want to save time, web scraping extensions and software are better choices.\n\nFinal Words\n\nAmazon is a gold mine of data. Scraping product data from Amazon can help you understand the market, trends, and your competitors. It can be the key to your business success.\n\nUsing web scraping tools like Octoparse, anyone can create Amazon product scrapers and use the data without having any coding knowledge. You should give Octoparse a try if you own or plan to own an online business. Start here and get the right data for business growth.\n\nAnyway, hope you find this article helpful! Happy Scraping!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n1. How often does Amazon update its product information?\n\nProduct metrics like Best Seller Rankings (BSR) can update every 15 minutes, so frequent and timely scraping is necessary to maintain accurate, real-time data for market intelligence.\n\n2. How can I validate scraped Amazon price and review data for accuracy？\n\nHere are a few things you can do to make sure your data isn’t leading you astray.\n\nFirst off, try pulling the same product data a few times, maybe at different times of the day or on different days. If the numbers jump around a lot, it could be because prices and reviews change, or maybe your scraper hit a snag.\n\nNext, take a quick peek yourself. Pick a handful of products and visit their pages manually. Does the price in your spreadsheet match what’s on the site? How about the star ratings and review counts?\n\nSince Amazon’s site changes often, your scraper might miss some info or grab outdated data if the page layout shifts. So, keep an eye on the structure of those pages and tweak your scraper when things look off.\n\nLastly, lots of people use smart tools and services that come with built-in ways to dodge blocks and CAPTCHAs, so your scraper doesn’t get cut off halfway through. That helps keep your data clean and reliable.\n\n3. Is it legal to scrape product data from Amazon?\n\nThe legality of scraping Amazon data depends on what data you scrape, how you scrape it, and how you use it.\n\nGenerally, scraping publicly available product information like titles, prices, and reviews is considered low risk, but scraping private account data can raise legal and privacy concerns.\n\nIt’s important to review Amazon’s Terms of Use and local laws before proceeding.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

    "context": "How to Export HTML Table to Excel\n\nAnsel Barrett February 8, 2025 6 min read\n\nWhy Export HTML Table to Excel\n\nExporting HTML tables to Excel offers numerous benefits, especially for those who work with large amounts of data or need to analyze information more effectively. Here are some compelling reasons why you might want to export data from HTML tables to Excel:\n\nSimplified Data Analysis HTML tables often contain valuable information, but analyzing and manipulating this data directly on a website can be tedious. By exporting the data to Excel, you can take advantage of powerful data analysis tools, such as sorting, filtering, and applying formulas to uncover insights more easily.\n\nEnhanced Reporting Excel is a widely recognized format for business reports. By converting HTML tables into Excel files, you can create professional reports, perform advanced calculations, and generate charts that are crucial for making informed decisions.\n\nData Cleanliness and Organization Web-based data might not always be in the most organized or structured format. When you export an HTML table to Excel, you gain more control over the data layout, enabling you to clean up inconsistencies, remove duplicates, and organize the data according to your needs.\n\nTime-Saving Manually copying and pasting data from HTML tables into Excel can be a time-consuming process, especially when dealing with large datasets. With automated tools, you can speed up this task, saving valuable time that could be better spent on analysis or other important activities.\n\nOffline Accessibility While HTML tables are hosted on websites, exporting them to Excel gives you offline access to the data. This is especially useful for working in areas with limited or no internet connectivity, or for maintaining a local copy of important data for record-keeping.\n\nSeamless Integration with Other Tools Once the HTML table data is in Excel format, you can easily integrate it with other software or tools that support Excel files. This includes importing data into databases, syncing with other business applications, or using it in presentations.\n\nBy understanding these advantages, it’s clear why exporting HTML tables to Excel can be an invaluable tool for streamlining data handling, improving analysis efficiency, and ensuring better decision-making processes.\n\nMethod 1: 3 Steps to Export HTML Table to Excel/CSV Non-coding\n\nOne of the easiest ways to scrape HTML tables to Excel is to use the best web scraping tool – Octoparse, which is used to extract data from web pages without any coding skills. Octoparse provides an automatic scraping process, or you can set up the whole scraper manually using its point-and-click interface. Also, it provides advanced functions like pagination, loop, scheduled scraping, IP rotation, etc.\n\nWith it, you can easily get the HTML tables into Excel files with the customized data field. What’s more, Octoparse provides preset data scraping templates for the most popular sites, which allows you to export HTML table data to Excel within only a few clicks. Try the online Yahoo Cryptocurrencies scraping template below to get table data easily.\n\nScrape Yahoo Cryptocurrencies Finance Scrape cryptocurrency information (coin name, market cap, etc) from Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlso, you can export HTML tables into Excel or CSV format by building a web crawler in Octoparse so that you can make as many changes as you need. Follow the simple steps below to start.\n\nStep 1: Copy and paste the table page link to Octoparse\n\nLaunch Octoparse after you have downloaded and installed it on your device. Then paste the URL that you want to get the data from in the search field in the Octoparse home section, and click on the Start button to begin the auto-detecting scraping.\n\nStep 2: Select the table data that needs to scrape\n\nAfter the quick auto-detection, a workflow will be created. You can check the scraped data fields in the preview section. You can also turn off the auto-detecting mode and build a workflow by yourself.\n\nFollow the tips given to customize your table data. For example, you can double-click the field name to rename the data fields. Click the More button next to the field’s name for more actions.\n\nStep 3: Run the table scraper and export the data\n\nAfter selecting the table that needs to be exported, click on the Run button to start getting the table data. The extracted data can be exported in formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON. If you want to export directly to a database, you can do that too.\n\nYou can read the article about how to scrape website to Excel easily to learn about more methods of extracting more kinds of web data.\n\nMethod 2: Import HTML Table to Excel Directly\n\nYou can also use Excel’s “Get data from Web” feature to directly import the HTML table into Excel. You can follow the below steps to directly import HTML tables into Excel.\n\nStep 1: Open the Excel file into which you want to import the table. Then in the ribbon, at the top, click on Data.\n\nStep 2: Then click on the ‘From Web’ option. Enter the URL from where you want to import the table from.\n\nStep 3: In the ‘Navigator Section’, select the table that you want to import and click ‘Transform Data’.\n\nStep 4: Finally, click on Close and Load and the data from the table will be loaded into the Excel sheet.\n\nMethod 3: Copy HTML Tables to Excel using JavaScript\n\nYou can also use Javascript code to export the HTML table into Excel. This method is available for those who have some coding knowledge, and you can try the following steps and coding lines for reference.\n\n<button id=\"btnExport\" onclick=\"exportReportToExcel(this)\">Export HTML Table</button> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> function exportReportToExcel() { let table = document.getElementsByID(\"table\"); TableToExcel.convert(table[0], { name: `file.xlsx`, sheet: { name: 'Sheet 1' } }); } </script>\n\nThe above code creates a button to export HTML to a table. You can also read more about it from here.\n\nFirst, we get the table by using the getElementsByID() function. Then, once we get the table from the page, we will use the library TableToExcel and convert it into Excel format.\n\nWe will then define the names of the Excel file and Excel sheet after that. In the above example, “file.xlsx” is the name of the file, and the name of the sheet is “Sheet 1”. You can change these values to change the name.\n\nHowever, if you are not into coding, then you can use the above two methods, with which you can easily export the HTML table into Excel format.\n\nFinal Words\n\nSo if you want to export any HTML table to Excel Sheets, then you can use any one of the above three methods. If you know how to code, you can use the JavaScript method to extract the HTML table data, or else you can use Octoparse or directly import the data into Excel with its auto-detecting or the preset templates features. What’s more, you can explore more ways to scrape data from a table.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

Pick a free web crawler to start, you can:\n\nHow to Choose a Free Site Crawler\n\nYou may have a similar question: Is there a real free web crawler? The answer is YES. Besides the easy-to-use quality, what you should take into account when you are choosing a free web crawler:\n\nScalability/limit of use\n\nWhat data are you looking for and how much are you aiming to scrape? If you want to start from a free web crawler and at the same time meet your need for data extraction, you should pay attention to how scalable the tool is and whether is there any limit of use for a free plan.\n\nData quality\n\nIn most cases, data is not the end. What people expect from data is to generate ideas and insights or to guide their decision-making process. However, raw data from the web may not apply to analysis right away. What you have to do is to clean the data so that the computer can understand and help analyze it. To make this easier, you can choose a web crawler integrated with data cleaning features to free you from repetitive manual jobs.\n\nCustomer service\n\nEven though automated web crawling tools have simplified much of the web scraping process for beginners, users could still encounter unexpected problems. Web crawling tools are not omnipotent because of the existing challenges in web scraping. With support from your side, you can have a smooth start and go further.\n\nTop 9 Free Web Crawlers in 2025\n\n1. Octoparse\n\nOctoparse is a free web crawler built for non-coders.

These preset data templates are designed for popular websites like Amazon, eBay, TikTok, X, etc. With them, users only need to enter a few keywords and then wait for the results.

Don’t worry, Octoparse help center and live chat customer service will support you all the time.\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\n2. 80legs\n\n80legs is a JavaScript-based application that offers a custom web crawling service for users to configure their crawler and scrape from public web pages.

There is a 14-day data retention for your scraped data, so do remember to back up. Text and video tutorials are both available.\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\n6. Dexi.io\n\nDexi.io is a cloud-based web crawling tool and there are four types of robots you can choose from, including Extractor, Crawler, Pipes, and ButoBot.\n\nThe tool itself can be highly functional, while no automation framework is available for new starters to pick up quickly.

    "context": "How to Scrape Data to Boost Your Online Business\n\nAbigail Jones March 21, 2023 8 min read\n\nThe Three Stages of E-Commerce Business\n\nGenerally, there are three stages of running an e-Commerce business, planning and launching, growth and optimizing, and scaling up and expanding. The main missions of each phase are different.\n\nGreat business often starts with a small idea. But the idea must first, however, show promise of success. As a result, most businesses begin by evaluating the initial business idea, then developing a detailed and practical plan with it. It is the most important task during the planning and launch phase. Digging into the market at this stage will help get valuable information and persuasive proof that can support the upcoming commercial actions.\n\nAlthough the e-Commerce market is still expanding, some research has pointed out only 10% of online businesses succeed on average, with the majority failing within the first 120 days. So, there is not much time for breaks following the launch. To make sure customers can come in and business grows as intended, daily operations will become a primary concern. Yet, an undercurrent of slow growth might soon emerge. In order to overcome this difficulty, some actions should be prioritized, such as expanding the customer base, improving the products, and developing marketing strategies.\n\nIf an e-Commerce company can stay in good shape and turn a profit during the second phase, business expansion can be put on the agenda. The business must have achieved a solid customer base, a good business model, more importantly, a huge database about its products, competitors, and the entire market, before scaling up. This database can serve as a road map for growing the company, entering new markets, releasing products, etc.\n\nThus, whatever stage your e-Commerce business is in, data always plays a critical role in decision-making, problem-solving, and optimization. But filtering valuable data from the flood of the Internet all by hand is out of the question. Web scraping tools, to some extent, are born to address this problem.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some examples of typical web scraping and data-use scenarios in each stage of the e-Commerce business, and how Octoparse can be applied to boost the business.\n\nPlan and Find a Product That Will Sell Like Crazy\n\nThe first phase is about planning and launching a business. We all know that building a business from scratch is no simple task. There is still a long way to go when there is a desire or an idea to create an online business or sell goods online. What can make a product the next hit? The answer is beside the item itself, customers’ preferences, market demands, sales channels, and even commercial partners need to be taken into account.\n\nLocate the right product but not create it behind closed doors\n\nBefore going forward, the more time you spend researching and validating your product ideas, the better your choice of succeeding. Finding the right products and targeting the correct market can allow you to achieve twice as much accomplish with only half the effort.\n\nCustomers’ behaviors are complicated and almost unlikely to be measured. Sometimes you put a lot of effort into observing and even designing polls to collect their opinions, but what you get is not what it is supposed to be. But data always reflects their tendencies even though they might have never realized that. Product sales, ratings, reviews, and other metrics reveal how much consumers adore, value, and desire a product. To be more precise, a good user persona, an analysis of market demand, comprehensive market research, etc., all develop from this raw data material.\n\nLuckily, we can access all this information on most online shopping platforms now. And web scraping tools make it easy to collect thousands of lines from these websites in one go. After grabbing data and crossing various websites, then analyzing the characters of users among different platforms, you can find what to sell and locate the most potential market for your business.\n\nFind the perfect partners for your business\n\nNo one can create and maintain a successful business without partners. Even while operating an online store may require fewer human resources than a conventional one, you still need the assistance of suppliers and delivery services to make sure you have enough products for sale and that customers can get their orders on time.\n\nFinding reliable suppliers and delivering services is an important task to do during the first phase. Not only will it be a crucial component of your company plan, but it’ll also impact your business model and day-to-day operations in the following phases. The official websites of the producers are valuable resources when determining whether businesses are worthwhile to work with. With some e-Commerce sites, though, you can see how they genuinely perform. For instance, Alibaba gathers a lot of manufacturers, suppliers, wholesalers, etc., on its site. You can easily scrape locations, business licenses, and products from each manufacturer and supplier from Alibaba. With this knowledge, you might be able to find cooperation quickly without getting lost.\n\nYou can also learn about express delivery services from relevant websites by collecting shipping information. Online shops usually highlight shipping fees, expected shipping times, and shipping-from locations of products. That can be your reference to decide which delivery solutions might fit your business and the budget for shipping service.\n\nDecide on the best sales channel for your business\n\nYour products will reach the right audience in the most effective way by choosing the right platform, which will also boost your sales and profitability. This implies that you can maximize your return on investment while raising your chances of closing deals and producing income.\n\nTo select an ideal one, you can first consider your target audience and the unique characteristics of your products, then research and evaluate the different sales channels available, such as online shopping platforms and social media. For example, if you are going to sell high-end luxury goods, a discount marketplace like eBay might never be on your list. Moreover, Lazada will not be your first choice if your target market is the U.S. or Europe, since most of their users come from Southeast Asia. And of course, this information is contained in the data you can extract from websites.\n\nThe use of data is crucial in this process. You can pull data from a wide range of platforms in many areas to evaluate which one fits your business. For example, tracking the best sellers to gain insights into which kinds of items are popular on these platforms, and extracting customer feedback and reviews to understand which channels they prefer and which ones may be causing issues or barriers to purchase.\n\nHere are some big players in online shopping that you can use Octoparse to scrape data from:\n\nSkyrocket Your Sales in the Growth and Optimization Stage\n\nAccording to some research, up to 90% of e-Commerce start-up businesses fail. Thus, when your e-Commerce business steps into this phase, congratulations! You have survived the most challenging stage! Now you might have some loyal customers, reliable partners, and proper channels to sell your products. In the following phase, you are likely to experience steady growth, and the main missions will change into maintaining business in a healthy state and boosting sales to maximize profitability.\n\nManage your inventory like a pro\n\nMaking you have enough inventory is one of the most crucial and significant tasks in daily operations. By keeping your inventory current, you can meet your customers’ demands on time. As a result, you might increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. Meanwhile, it’s an effective means to avoid overstocking to minimize storage costs.\n\nYou can use data such as sales volume, revenue, average order value, stock quantities, etc., to forecast demand and adjust your inventory levels accordingly. This information can originate from your own sales records as well as the platform listings for your suppliers. However, these kinds of data are fast-changing. To get the latest data, you can use web scraping tools to track all wanted data around the clock. Then you are more likely to be clear about when to stock products and how many you should stock.\n\nOptimize user experience from bounce to buy\n\nUser experience directly impacts customer satisfaction which in turn contributes to business success. A good experience can improve customer retention, increase sales, and boost brand reputation. There are numerous ways to improve user experience, but no matter what course of action you decide to take, the foundation is knowing how customers feel about your products and services and what appeals to them.\n\nData is a fantastic intermediary for understanding clients, as was previously mentioned. Enhancing user experience in this phase can help you in many ways. By scraping customer feedback, you may learn what your customers appreciate about your goods and services and where they think there is room for improvement. Then you can make targeted changes to better customer experience.\n\nMeanwhile, you can track sales data to spot patterns in consumer behavior, such as the most popular products, most profitable pages, and most successful promotions. Additionally, it is necessary to monitor social media channels to observe what people are saying about your business.\n\nDon’t let your product go unnoticed\n\nCountless pieces of information flow on the Internet every second. Every product in online shops can be submerged under the data floor without any sound. This phenomenon pushes e-Commerce merchants to try their best to improve products’ visibility so that more audiences can see their products.\n\nImproved titles and descriptions are very common methods for increasing products’ exposure. Often, shoppers use specific keywords to find products when searching online. Therefore, optimizing product titles and crafting product descriptions with relevant keywords and phrases that accurately describe the product and its features can help reach more potential customers.\n\nData plays a crucial role in this area as well. You can scrape search queries and results on search engines like Google to analyze which keywords and phrases are most relevant in driving traffic to your products or competitor goods. Additionally, web scraping tools can help extract product titles and descriptions from online shopping platforms. This data can be utilized to determine what words and phrases are most effective at catching people’s attention as well.\n\nMonitor your competitors and win in your market\n\nThe e-Commerce industry is incredibly competitive. Staying ahead of the competition requires competitor analysis in every business plan. It allows you to identify your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, adjust your strategy accordingly then help maintain your market position. As part of competitor monitoring, data is crucial in almost every step, including identifying competitors, monitoring their performance, analyzing their content, monitoring their pricing, etc.\n\nTo identify your competitors, you can use web scraping tools to extract their product offerings, prices, and company information to determine your rivals. Along with prices, you may scrape their prices, sales figures, product reviews, and ratings to observe how your competitors are performing and then determine where you can improve.\n\nYour competitors also can be your best teacher in optimizing marketing content. To be more specific, you can analyze their content strategy by collecting their product titles, descriptions, campaign content, and even social media posts to understand how they engage with their audience. It’ll help you improve your own content and marketing strategy.\n\nDuring this phase, Octoparse can be applied to several aspects, including:\n\nBring Your Business to a New Level in Expanding Phase\n\nYour e-Commerce business might enter a new phase once it has built a solid client base and a successful business strategy. This new phase of scaling up focuses on expanding operations and increasing revenue. It entailed making a conscious effort to broaden the consumer base, the range of available products, and the market reach.\n\nLaunch new products with a winning strategy\n\nOne primary aspect of this phase is the expansion of the product line to introduce new products and services to cater to customers’ growing needs and preferences. You must be aware, having gone through the building phase of a business, that launching a new product is intricate and demands careful preparation and execution. And you should not ignore the role of data.\n\nSimilar to what you have done in the phase of planning and launching, data is needed to conduct market research here. It called for data from a wider spectrum. You need to analyze sales, profits, and feedback on your own offerings, and also scrape customer feedback to conduct sentiment analysis to understand how people think about your products. Additionally, market research requires data that can reflect the current trend, for instance, tracking best sellers, collecting sales and feedback data of your competitors, etc.\n\nWith the help of data, you’ll develop an insightful plan for the new product line. And by diversifying the product offerings, your e-Commerce business can increase revenue streams and reduce the risk of relying on a single product.\n\nBreak into a new market\n\nWhen you look for new growth sparks, considering entering a new market can be a wise move. Because a new market will let your business tap into a new customer base, reduce dependence on a single market, and increase brand visibility.\n\nIt’s like climbing a mountain you don’t know when you enter a new market. In this scenario, a map becomes essential, and in the world of e-Commerce business, a data-driven plan is a map. Before you make the final decision, you need web scraping tools to grab sufficient data to complete your plan. In this context, competition monitoring through data extraction can be utilized to identify market gaps and gain an advantage in certain markets. Also, you may use web scraping to understand client preferences and demographics by obtaining information like age, gender, and problem areas.\n\nOptimize business strategy with smart goals\n\nThe business strategy, in fact, is important in every phase of any business. The expansion of a business requires a more detailed, insightful, and data-driven business strategy. Market research, competitor monitoring, price monitoring, and consumer sentiment monitoring with web scraping tools are all necessary, but you need to focus more on your brand and reputation at that time.\n\nTherefore, you can apply web scraping tools to reputation management, take advantage of tracking mentions and sentiment, and automate reputation management tasks. Then you can optimize your business strategy to meet customer needs better and set your business for long-term growth and sustainability.\n\nThe Octoparse Way to Go the Extra Mile in E-Commerce\n\nEfficiency is the key to success in this high-paced society. The same idea is suitable for the e-Commerce industry. Besides making web scraping easier for everyone, Octoparse has put more effort into helping users improve working efficiency and reduce labor costs in several aspects.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can improve scraping efficiency with Octoparse.\n\nOctoparse is aware of the characteristics of websites and data and considers practically every aspect or situation in which a user can apply the tool. So whatever frequencies you want to scrape data or what platforms you aim to pull data from, Octoparse is likely to give an optimal solution to web scraping and help your business go the extra mile.\n\nWrap-up\n\nRunning an online business is a long-term game. Data can be its compass as well as its fuel. Web scraping is, therefore, essential to every phase of an online business. Market research, competition analysis, price monitoring, competitor monitoring, and other business operations can all benefit from the use of a top-notch web scraping tool like Octoparse. No matter what stage your business is in, making greater use of data and web scraping will help it.\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nHot posts\n\nExplore topics\n\nGet started with Octoparse today\n\nStart a free trial Free Download\n\nRelated Articles",

It serves two primary purposes:\n\nModern websites, especially those using JavaScript or Adobe Flash menus, benefit significantly from well-structured sitemaps.\n\nGoogle developed XML sitemaps specifically to help web crawlers identify and index dynamic content that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nAll other search engines, including Bing, also support this method.\n\nHow Often Does Google Crawl Sitemaps?\n\nGoogle doesn’t follow a fixed schedule for crawling sitemaps. The frequency depends on several factors:\n\nGenerally, Google checks sitemaps anywhere from daily to weekly for active websites. You can monitor crawling activity through Google Search Console and automatically generate sitemaps to ensure fresh content gets indexed promptly.\n\nWhy Sitemap Crawling Is Essential for Your Website\n\nSEO Benefits:\n\nSite Management:\n\nUser Experience:\n\n10 Best Sitemap Crawler and Scraper Tools\n\nIn this portion of the post, we will offer recommendations for the best sitemap scraper to utilize when attempting to extract data from a sitemap file.\n\n1.

Users may reorganize the structure, categorize pages, and give a process status to each page using the sitemap editor.\n\nKey Features:\n\n9. Google XML Sitemaps (plugin)\n\nUse this plugin to dramatically boost SEO by creating specific XML sitemaps that will assist search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask.com in better indexing your site.\n\nKey Features:\n\n10.

Additionally, it will help you in deciding which sitemap crawler is best for you.\n\nFor the individuals and organizations that want a one-stop & no-code solution for their web crawling queries, they can go for Octoparse.\n\nFAQs\n\nUse enterprise-level tools like Deepcrawl or Screaming Frog SEO Spider for large-scale automation.

    "context": "Top 10 Data Extraction Tools in 2025\n\nAnsel Barrett August 25, 2022 8 min read\n\nWhat Is Data Extraction\n\nAn introduction to data extraction\n\nIt is the process of gathering information from several sources of data for further visualization and interpretation to obtain insightful corporate data or for storing in a centralized data warehouse. Unstructured, semi-structured, or structured information can be obtained from several sources. In a nutshell, data extraction is a method of obtaining data from one source and transferring it to another, whether it be on-site, cloud-based, or a combination of the two.\n\nTo do this, a variety of tactics are used, some of which are complicated and often include manual input. Extraction, transformation, and loading, or ETL, is often the initial phase, unless information is just retrieved for archive needs. This indicates that upon primary collection, information almost always goes through further transformation to make it suitable for subsequent review.\n\nTypes of data extraction\n\nHaving received a fundamental grasp of how data extraction functions, let us just examine the types of data extraction strategies that are frequently employed in the market. The two primary categories of data extraction techniques are logical and physical which can be further divided into other types.\n\n1. Logical Data Extraction\n\nIt is the most used data extraction approach. It can be categorized into two subcategories.\n\nFull Extraction\n\nThis process frequently arises during the beginning load. Hence, all the data is simply pulled from the resource in one go. Since this extraction captures all information that is currently accessible on the source system, there is no need to maintain track of the progress after successful extraction.\n\nIncremental Extraction\n\nThe delta changes in the data are the focus of this technique. You must first apply complex extraction algorithms to the data sources as a data scientist and maintain track of data improvements and upgrades. The revised data extraction timestamps are collected using this technique.\n\n2. Physical Data Extraction\n\nLogical Extraction may be challenging to use when trying to extract data from outdated data storage systems. This data can only be obtained by physical extractions. It can also be broken down into two categories.\n\nOnline Extraction\n\nDirect data extraction from the data source to the appropriate Data Warehouse is possible with this technique. This approach requires a direct link between the source system and the extraction tools in order to function. You can attach it to the transitional system, which is a near exact clone of the source system but with better organized data, rather than directly connecting it to the source.\n\nOffline Extraction\n\nInstead of being directly retrieved from the original source, the data is intentionally processed outside of it in this approach. In this procedure, the data is either organized or may be structured utilizing techniques for data extraction. A flat file, a dump file, or a remote extraction from database transaction logs are a few of the file structures it incorporates.\n\nBenefits of using data extraction\n\nData extraction tools significantly improve the accuracy of data transfer since they are used mostly without human intervention, which minimizes partiality and mistakes therefore raises the fineness of the data.\n\n“Which data must be extracted” is primarily determined by data extraction tools. This is done while obtaining data from many sources since the tools correctly identify the precise data needed for the action in consideration and leave the rest for further transfers.\n\nThe usage of data extraction tools allows organizations to choose the size of the data collection they wish to do. It helps you prevent manually paging through sources to get information, additionally allowing you simply choose how much data is gathered and for what purposes.\n\n10 Best Data Extractors You Should Know\n\nData extraction tools come in a wide variety which may be used to gather and monitor information about your promotional campaigns.
