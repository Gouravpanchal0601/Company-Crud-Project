    "context": "Top 10 Most Scraped Websites in 2025\n\nAnsel Barrett March 6, 2025 8 min read\n\nBest Web Scraping Tool for Anyone\n\nBefore starting, we’d like to introduce an easy-to-use web scraping tool. Octoparse, which is designed for both non-coders and coders. With its auto-detecting function and preset scraping templates, you can scrape any popular website without coding. What’s more, you can customize the crawler with its advanced functions such as cloud scraping, proxies, IP rotation, etc.\n\nWhat is an Octoparse task template? For programmers, to scrape the web, they can write scripts and run them in Python or whatever way. A task template is like an already written script and the only part you have to do is to figure out what data you want and enter the keywords or URLs on our task template interface. You can find the data scraping template both online and on the desktop software, try the general one below to make your web scraping easy.\n\nContact Details Scraper Social Media Not just an email extractor, but a universal scraper that extracts contact details from any website and its subpages.\n\nWhat Types of Websites are Popular for Scraping\n\nWhen it comes to web scraping, certain types of websites are more frequently targeted due to the valuable data they offer. These websites typically provide large volumes of publicly available information, making them ideal for businesses, researchers, and marketers. In this section, we’ll explore the types of websites that are most commonly scraped and why they attract so much attention.\n\nE-commerce sites\n\nE-commerce sites are always the most scraped websites among others, both in frequency and quantity. As shopping online becomes a household lifestyle, e-commerce affects people from all walks of life. Online sellers, storefront retailers, and even consumers are all e-commerce data collectors.\n\nMost E-commerce websites use a hierarchical structure, such as Amazon, one of the most visited websites on the world (according to SEMRush report, Amazon has more than 2.6 billion visits per month). Users browse products in lists sorted by categories and filters. They then open pages with detailed information about each product.\n\nOne of the most used methods for scraping Amazon and other E-commerce websites is list crawling.\n\nDirectories sites for leads\n\nDirectories sites earn the second rank in the race, and this isn’t surprising at all. Directories sites organize businesses by categories and thus serve as a functional information filter which is a good pick for efficient data collection.\n\nIn terms of site structure, directories show organized business lists. The homepage and category pages help users filter results. Each listing includes contact details and business info.\n\nMany are scraping directory sites for extracting emails, phone numbers and other contact information to boost their sales leads.\n\nSocial media sites\n\nSocial media incorporates a wealth of information concerning human opinions, emotions, and daily actions. Other than that, they are often popular sites; for example, Facebook is the top 3 most visited website, gaining more than 9.6 billion visits per month.\n\nMost social media sites feature dynamic feeds and user profiles. Content is shown in timelines or grids. Navigation sorts posts by topics, hashtags, or user connections.\n\nGenerally speaking, scraping data from social media sites is more challenging than from others. That is because many social media sites employ strong anti-scraping techniques to protect users’ privacy. Yet, social media still serves as an important source of information for sentiment analysis and all kinds of research.\n\nOthers\n\nOther sites fall into categories such as Jobs, Tourism, Real Estate, and Search Engine. People of all industries are taking advantage of the web scraping technique to exploit data value to serve their interests.\n\nBefore learning the top 10 most popular websites in detail, you should know the legality problems of web scraping. Also, you can learn the web scraping use cases for different industries.\n\nTop 10 Most Scraped Websites\n\nTop 10.
